<p>Your one-stop solution for validating predicates in various sources.</p>
</div>

## Project Description

The "LLMFactCheck" is a powerful tool designed to validate predicates in different sources, ensuring the accuracy of references and enhancing the quality of your research.


## Installation

To run the LLMFactCheck tool, you'll need to set up the necessary environment and install the required packages.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. You'll also need to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```shell
# Create a virtual environment (venv)
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate
```

# Install Dependencies
To install the project dependencies, use the following command:

```shell
# Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage
After completing the installation, you can run the LLMFactCheck tool using the following command:

```shell
# Copy code
# Run LLMFactCheck for Semmed database
cd src
python3 main.py --predication_file data/semmed_predicate.csv --sentence_file data/semmed_sentence.csv
```


# Project Structure
This part of the project follows a well-organized structure for easy navigation and management. 
Here's a quick overview:

**src:** Contains the main code and data for working with the Semmed database.
  
  - `main.py`: ðŸš€ Main file that invokes the core logic.

  - **util:**
    - `result_writing.py`: File for writing results.
    - `data_processing.py`: File for data processing.
    - `llama_interaction.py`: File for interacting with the Llama model.

  - **result:** Results of Semmed predicate validation will be stored here.
    - `semmed_result_console_app.csv`

  - **check:** Contains data you are checking and code for checking results.
    - **data:**
      - `data_file.csv`: Your data for validation.
    - `check_results.py`: File for checking results.
    
  - **previous_version:** Previous issues
    - `lcpp_llm_predicate__sentence_result.ipynb`
  

## How It Works

1. **Run the Tool**: Execute the main script from the "src" folder, and watch as the tool works its magic.

2. **View Results**: The results of the predicate validation process will be stored in the "results". You can review them to identify any issues with the references.

3. **Celebrate**: You've successfully checked predicates with LLMFactCheck! ðŸŽ‰

Feel free to explore the source code in the "src" folder for customization or to understand the inner workings of the tool.

### New Features

- **Support for Multiple Sources**: LLMFactCheck now supports validating predicates in various sources, not limited to Semmed. You can easily extend its functionality for different datasets.

- **Console Application**: We've introduced a new console application that allows you to validate predicates in different sources using the command line. This provides more flexibility and ease of use, especially in environments where a database connection may not be available.
Enjoy using LLMFactCheck for all your predicate validation needs!



## Conclusion

LLMFactCheck simplifies the process of checking predicates in various sources. Whether you're a researcher or a data enthusiast, our tool will help you ensure the accuracy and quality of your data. Happy validating!
