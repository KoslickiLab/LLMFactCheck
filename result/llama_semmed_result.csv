The triple is not supported because there are no sentences that explicitly state all three points.'  Correct.  The sentence does not mention 'regional differences in animal population density' or 'the avoidance of ""copy strains""'.  It only mentions the reduction of microbial resistance to antimicrobial agents.

The correct triple would be:

1. Therapeutic procedure uses Microbicides
2. Reduces microbial resistance to antimicrobial agents
3. Avoids ""copy strains"""
10595006,Therapeutic procedure uses Microbicides,64,"In applied antimicrobial therapy, the data can serve as a decision guidance in choosing the antimicrobial agent most adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation.",Undefined,"Is the triple 'Therapeutic procedure uses Microbicides' supported by the sentence: 'In applied antimicrobial therapy, the data can serve as a decision guidance in choosing the antimicrobial agent most adapted to the prevailing epidemiological situation.'?","I don't think so.

1. Blastocyst stage: The sentence mentions that HpNanos mRNA accumulates during the blastula stages, which includes the blastocyst stage. This implies that the gene is expressed in the blastocyst structure.
2. Mesenchyme: The sentence also states that HpNanos mRNA decreases in abundance at the mesenchyme blastula stage. Mesenchyme is a type of cells found in the embryo that gives rise to connective tissue, including the extracellular matrix and other cell types.
3. Part: The word ""part"" suggests that HpNanos mRNA is expressed in a specific part of the mesenchyme, which supports the idea that the gene is involved in the development of the blastocyst structure.

Therefore, based on this sentence, it can be inferred that HpNanos is expressed in the blastocyst structure and plays a role in the development of the mesenchyme during embryonic development"
