4669,,,,,"Given the individual patient risk profiles and the fact that bivalirudin prevented approximately 6 major bleeds for each MI that might occur from its use, the estimated reduction in bleeding was greater than the estimated increase in MI by bivalirudin alone rather than heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor for nearly all patients.",,,,

4679,,,,,Bivalirudin (an anti-thrombin oligopeptide) has been approved for preventing thrombosis in unstable angina patients following angioplasty in adjunct to aspirin.,,,,
4680,,,,,"Conclusion:     The risk of bleeding and the incidence of NACE are significantly lower for patients using bivalirudin during perioperative period of PCI compared to heparin, without significant differences in ischemic events.",,,,
4681,,,,,"Owing to the pharmacodynamic properties of bivalirudin, areas of blood stagnation should be carefully avoided in order to limit the risk of thrombosis.",,,,
