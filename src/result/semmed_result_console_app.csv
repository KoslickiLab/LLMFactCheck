10592604,Arboviruses process of Lepus capensis,16,Seroprevalence of tick-borne and mosquito-borne arboviruses in European brown hares in Northern and Western Germany.,False,Is the triple 'Arboviruses process of Lepus capensis' supported by the sentence: 'Seroprevalence of tick-borne and mosquito-borne arboviruses in European brown hares in Northern and Western Germany.'?
10592697,Tahyna virus is a California Group Viruses,17,"Tribec virus (Kemerovo serogroup, genus Orbivirus), Eyach virus (genus Coltivirus), and Tahyna virus (California encephalitis serogroup, genus Bunyavirus) are arthropod-borne viruses known to occur in Germany.",False,"Is the triple 'Tahyna virus is a California Group Viruses' supported by the sentence: 'Tribec virus (Kemerovo serogroup, genus Orbivirus), Eyach virus (genus Coltivirus), and Tahyna virus (California encephalitis serogroup, genus Bunyavirus) are arthropod-borne viruses known to occur in Germany.'?
No, the sentence does not support the triple 'Tahyna virus is a California Group Viruses'. The sentence mentions three different viruses: Tribec virus (Kemerovo serogroup), Eyach virus (genus Coltivirus), and Tahyna virus (California encephalitis serogroup, genus Bunyavirus). While Tahyna virus is a member of the California encephalitis serogroup, it is not specifically identified as a California Group Viruses."
10592728,Eyach virus is a Coltivirus,17,"Tribec virus (Kemerovo serogroup, genus Orbivirus), Eyach virus (genus Coltivirus), and Tahyna virus (California encephalitis serogroup, genus Bunyavirus) are arthropod-borne viruses known to occur in Germany.",True,"Is the triple 'Eyach virus is a Coltivirus' supported by the sentence: 'Tribec virus (Kemerovo serogroup, genus Orbivirus), Eyach virus (genus Coltivirus), and Tahyna virus (California encephalitis serogroup, genus Bunyavirus) are arthropod-borne viruses known to occur in Germany.'?

Yes. The sentence states that Eyach virus is a member of the genus Coltivirus."
10592759,California Group Viruses is a Arboviruses,17,"Tribec virus (Kemerovo serogroup, genus Orbivirus), Eyach virus (genus Coltivirus), and Tahyna virus (California encephalitis serogroup, genus Bunyavirus) are arthropod-borne viruses known to occur in Germany.",False,"Is the triple 'California Group Viruses is a Arboviruses' supported by the sentence: 'Tribec virus (Kemerovo serogroup, genus Orbivirus), Eyach virus (genus Coltivirus), and Tahyna virus (California encephalitis serogroup, genus Bunyavirus) are arthropod-borne viruses known to occur in Germany.'?
No, the sentence does not support the triple. The sentence mentions three viruses that are known to occur in Germany: Tribec virus, Eyach virus, and Tahyna virus. However, only two of these viruses belong to the Arboviridae family (Tribec virus and Eyach virus), while Tahyna virus belongs to the Bunyaviridae family. Therefore, the triple ""California Group Viruses is a Arboviruses"" is not supported by the sentence."
10592832,Disease process of Human,18,These viruses are also suspected to cause human disease.,False,"Is the triple 'Disease process of Human' supported by the sentence: 'These viruses are also suspected to cause human disease.'?
No, the triple ""Disease process of Human"" is not supported by the sentence ""These viruses are also suspected to cause human disease."" The sentence only states that the viruses are suspected to cause disease, but it does not provide any information about the specific disease processes that may be involved.

To support the triple ""Disease process of Human,"" you would need additional information, such as:

* The specific diseases caused by these viruses (e.g., HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, etc.)
* The mechanisms by which these viruses cause disease (e.g., disrupting cellular processes, triggering immune responses, etc.)
* Any relevant clinical or pathological information about the diseases caused by these viruses (e.g., symptoms, diagnosis, treatment options, etc.)."
10592873,Virus causes Disease,18,These viruses are also suspected to cause human disease.,False,"Is the triple 'Virus causes Disease' supported by the sentence: 'These viruses are also suspected to cause human disease.'?
No, the sentence ""These viruses are also suspected to cause human disease"" does not support the triple ""Virus causes Disease"". The sentence only suggests that these particular viruses may be associated with human diseases, but it does not directly state that they do so. To support the triple ""Virus causes Disease"", a more direct statement would be needed, such as ""These viruses have been shown to cause human disease."""
10593057,Lepus capensis location of Antibodies,23,"For the first time, antibodies against Tribec virus could be found in a European brown hare in Germany.",False,"Is the triple 'Lepus capensis location of Antibodies' supported by the sentence: 'For the first time, antibodies against Tribec virus could be found in a European brown hare in Germany.'
No, the sentence does not support the triple. The sentence states that antibodies against Tribec virus were found in a European brown hare in Germany, but it does not mention anything about Lepus capensis or location of antibodies."
10593208,Binding Protein part of FHL1,26,"Structure-function mapping of BbCRASP-1, the key complement factor H and FHL-1 binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi.",False,"Is the triple 'Binding Protein part of FHL1' supported by the sentence: 'Structure-function mapping of BbCRASP-1, the key complement factor H and FHL-1 binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi.'?

The text does not mention ""Triple"" or any similar term. The phrase ""Binding Protein part of FHL1"" is a paraphrase of the original sentence and should be avoided as it could lead to confusion. Instead, you can use the following phrases:

* ""FHL-1 binding protein""
* ""BbCRASP-1, a key complement factor H and FHL-1 binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi""
* ""Complement regulator BbCRASP-1 is a binding partner of both human factor H and FHL-1"""
10593243,COMPLEMENT FACTOR H|CFH part of Borrelia burgdorferi,26,"Structure-function mapping of BbCRASP-1, the key complement factor H and FHL-1 binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi.",False,"Is the triple 'COMPLEMENT FACTOR H|CFH part of Borrelia burgdorferi' supported by the sentence: 'Structure-function mapping of BbCRASP-1, the key complement factor H and FHL-1 binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi.'?
No, the triple ""COMPLEMENT FACTOR H|CFH"" is not explicitly mentioned in the given sentence. The sentence mentions ""BbCRASP-1"", ""complement factor H (CFH)"", and ""FHL-1 binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi""."
10593287,Binding Protein part of Borrelia burgdorferi,26,"Structure-function mapping of BbCRASP-1, the key complement factor H and FHL-1 binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi.",False,"Is the triple 'Binding Protein part of Borrelia burgdorferi' supported by the sentence: 'Structure-function mapping of BbCRASP-1, the key complement factor H and FHL-1 binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi.'?
No, the sentence ""Structure-function mapping of BbCRASP-1, the key complement factor H and FHL-1 binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi"" does not support the triple ""Binding Protein part of Borrelia burgdorferi"". The sentence mentions three different proteins (BbCRASP-1, complement factor H, and FHL-1) that are bound by BbCRASP-1, but it does not explicitly state that any of these proteins are binding proteins themselves. Therefore, the triple ""Binding Protein part of Borrelia burgdorferi"" cannot be inferred from this sentence."
