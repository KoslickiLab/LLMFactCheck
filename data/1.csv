However, this connection is not explicitly stated in the provided sentence, hence it's an indirect support."
16762875,Hydrocortisone treats congestive heart failure,44,"In multivariate regression analysis, cortisol was an independent predictor of Vo2peak (R2 = 0.365, F = 12.5, SE = 3.4; p<=0.001) and Ve/Vco2 slope (R2 = 0.154; F = 8.5; SE = 5.96; p = 0.006), after accounting for age, body mass index, sex, CHF etiology, creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ACTH in all patients.",False,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats congestive heart failure' supported by the sentence: 'In multivariate regression analysis, cortisol was an independent predictor of Vo2peak (R2 = 0.365, F = 12.5, SE = 3.4; p<=0.001) and Ve/Vco2 slope (R2 = 0.154; F = 8.5; SE = 5.96; p = 0.006), after accounting for age, body mass index, sex, CHF etiology, creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ACTH in all patients.'?","No, it is not directly or indirectly supported by the provided sentence. The statement is about cortisol as an independent predictor of Vo2peak (maximum oxygen uptake) and Ve/Vco2 slope (ventilation to carbon dioxide production ratio) in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). It does not mention Hydrocortisone specifically nor does it mention anything about treating congestive heart failure."
16290606,Hydrocortisone treats diabetes mellitus,45,"Increased cortisol results in diabetes, hence quelling the activity of 11betaHSD1 has been thought of as an effective approach for the treatment of diabetes.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats diabetes mellitus' supported by the sentence: 'Increased cortisol results in diabetes, hence quelling the activity of 11betaHSD1 has been thought of as an effective approach for the treatment of diabetes.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. The increased cortisol mentioned can be quelled with Hydrocortisone, which is an 11betaHSD1 inhibitor, thus treating diabetes."
15562961,Hydrocortisone treats skin atrophy,46,"Long-term application of topical HC induced skin atrophy, measured by a reduction in skinfold and epidermal thickness and in the number of epidermal proliferating cell nucleus antigen (PCNA)-positive keratinocytes.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats skin atrophy' supported by the sentence: 'Long-term application of topical HC induced skin atrophy, measured by a reduction in skinfold and epidermal thickness and in the number of epidermal proliferating cell nucleus antigen (PCNA)-positive keratinocytes.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because long term use of hydrocortisone (HC) can lead to skin atrophy as indicated in the given sentence, but it does not explicitly state that hydrocortisone is used to treat skin atrophy."
15127550,Hydrocortisone treats synovitis,47,"RESULTS: Following induction of synovitis, ground reaction forces were significantly decreased relative to preinduction values at 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 hours and serum cortisol concentration was significantly increased at 2.5 hours.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats synovitis' supported by the sentence: 'RESULTS: Following induction of synovitis, ground reaction forces were significantly decreased relative to preinduction values at 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 hours and serum cortisol concentration was significantly increased at 2.5 hours.'?","Yes, the statement is indirectly supported. The increase in serum cortisol concentration at 2.5 hours suggests that hydrocortisone (a synthetic form of cortisol) has been administered and is having an effect on the body. The decrease in ground reaction forces from 2.5 to 10 hours suggests that inflammation (synovitis) is being treated, as corticosteroids like hydrocortisone are often used to reduce inflammation. However, it's important to note that this is an inference based on the given data and the known effects of corticosteroids, not a direct statement in the provided sentence."
10942128,Hydrocortisone treats epilepsy,48,Hydrocortisone-induced convulsions.,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats epilepsy' supported by the sentence: 'Hydrocortisone-induced convulsions.'?,"No, it is not directly or indirectly supported. The statement ""Hydrocortisone-induced convulsions."" suggests that hydrocortisone can cause seizures or convulsions, which is the opposite of treating epilepsy, a condition characterized by recurrent seizures."
10815606,Hydrocortisone treats acute adrenal insufficiency,49,We describe a case of aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma (APA) associated with a probable post-operative adrenal crisis possibly due to subtle autonomous cortisol secretion.,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats acute adrenal insufficiency' supported by the sentence: 'We describe a case of aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma (APA) associated with a probable post-operative adrenal crisis possibly due to subtle autonomous cortisol secretion.'?,"No, it is not directly supported. The given statement discusses an instance of an aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma (APA) associated with a probable post-operative adrenal crisis, which is potentially due to subtle autonomous cortisol secretion, but it does not mention Hydrocortisone as a treatment for this condition."
10757641,Hydrocortisone treats gastric ulcer,50,Pantothenyl alcohol effect on delta-1-cortisol-induced gastric ulcers.,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats gastric ulcer' supported by the sentence: 'Pantothenyl alcohol effect on delta-1-cortisol-induced gastric ulcers.'?,"No, it is not directly supported because the two statements refer to different substances (Hydrocortisone and Pantothenyl alcohol) acting on gastric ulcers. However, it could be interpreted as indirectly supporting the idea that certain substances can have an impact on gastric ulcers."
10621320,Hydrocortisone treats contact dermatitis,51,[Contact eczema caused by hydrocortisone].,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats contact dermatitis' supported by the sentence: '[Contact eczema caused by hydrocortisone].'?,"No, it is not directly supported because the given sentence discusses a side effect of using hydrocortisone, not its therapeutic use for treating contact dermatitis."
