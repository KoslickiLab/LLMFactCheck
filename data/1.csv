This implies that prednisolone is used to treat ANCA-associated vasculitis, which is what the triple statement suggests."
24042094,Prednisolone treats biliary atresia,1093,"In 2010, a study on the advantages of budesonide compared to prednisolone in autoimmune hepatitis gave rise to experimental therapy using budesonide as an adjuvant BA treatment.",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats biliary atresia' supported by the sentence: 'In 2010, a study on the advantages of budesonide compared to prednisolone in autoimmune hepatitis gave rise to experimental therapy using budesonide as an adjuvant BA treatment.'?","No. This statement does not directly support that prednisolone treats biliary atresia (BA). Instead, it compares budesonide to prednisolone in autoimmune hepatitis treatments. It does not mention prednisolone as a treatment for BA."
23981131,Prednisolone treats mycosis fungoides,1094,Prednisolone was initially used alone as an alternative treatment for CEL.,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats mycosis fungoides' supported by the sentence: 'Prednisolone was initially used alone as an alternative treatment for CEL.'?,"No, it is not directly or indirectly supported. The reason is that CEL (Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia) is a type of blood cancer, while Mycosis Fungoides is a type of skin lymphoma, which is a completely different medical condition from CEL. The two diseases have different causes, symptoms, and treatments, so a treatment that works for one does not necessarily work for the other."
23374627,Prednisolone treats trichinellosis,1095,"This study assessed the antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory effects of Citrus limon and Capsicum frutescens on murine trichinellosis and compared them with those of albendazole and prednisolone, which are conventionally used to treat trichinellosis.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats trichinellosis' supported by the sentence: 'This study assessed the antiparasitic and anti-inflammatory effects of Citrus limon and Capsicum frutescens on murine trichinellosis and compared them with those of albendazole and prednisolone, which are conventionally used to treat trichinellosis.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because prednisolone is mentioned as one of the conventionally used treatments for trichinellosis in this study, even though it does not directly state that prednisolone is used to treat trichinellosis specifically because of its anti-inflammatory effects."
22580782,Prednisolone treats interstitial lung disease 2,1096,Regression of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma after the Withdrawal of Cyclosporin A Combined With Pirfenidone Treatment in a Patient with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.A 72-year-old man was treated with prednisolone and cyclosporine A for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats interstitial lung disease 2' supported by the sentence: 'Regression of Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma after the Withdrawal of Cyclosporin A Combined With Pirfenidone Treatment in a Patient with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis.A 72-year-old man was treated with prednisolone and cyclosporine A for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.'?,"No, it is not directly or indirectly supported, as this statement discusses a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis being treated with prednisolone and cyclosporine A, but it does not mention anything about interstitial lung disease, Prednisolone's effect on it, nor does it mention Pirfenidone treating it either."
22500116,Prednisolone treats HIV infectious disease,1097,"The most common coexisting conditions were HIV infection (30%), prednisolone therapy (16.9%), and diabetes mellitus (15.7%).",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats HIV infectious disease' supported by the sentence: 'The most common coexisting conditions were HIV infection (30%), prednisolone therapy (16.9%), and diabetes mellitus (15.7%).'?","No, it is not directly or indirectly supported. The given sentence mentions that HIV infection, prednisolone therapy, and diabetes mellitus coexist, but it does not imply that prednisolone is a treatment for HIV in any way."
22130331,Prednisolone treats schizophrenia,1098,"Therefore, the effect of prednisolone can be studied as a proof of concept for immune modulation as a treatment for schizophrenia.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats schizophrenia' supported by the sentence: 'Therefore, the effect of prednisolone can be studied as a proof of concept for immune modulation as a treatment for schizophrenia.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because both statements suggest a connection between Prednisolone and treatment for schizophrenia from an immunological perspective. However, it's important to note that Prednisolone is primarily a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation, not a treatment for schizophrenia. The sentence you provided is a speculative statement about studying its effects in relation to immune modulation as a potential treatment for schizophrenia."
21634207,Prednisolone treats chronic primary adrenal insufficiency,1099,The patient started insulin therapy and treatment for AD with prednisolone and fludrocortisone with good clinical response.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats chronic primary adrenal insufficiency' supported by the sentence: 'The patient started insulin therapy and treatment for AD with prednisolone and fludrocortisone with good clinical response.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported. The mention of prednisolone being used in treatment for AD (adrenal insufficiency) suggests that it can be an effective treatment, even if it does not specifically state that it is used to treat chronic primary adrenal insufficiency."
21254689,Prednisolone treats hypersensitivity pneumonitis,1100,We aimed to determine the effect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and azathioprine (AZA) on lung function and prednisolone dose in cHP patients.,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats hypersensitivity pneumonitis' supported by the sentence: 'We aimed to determine the effect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and azathioprine (AZA) on lung function and prednisolone dose in cHP patients.'?,"No, it is not directly supported because it does not mention any relationship between Prednisolone and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (cHP). It only mentions that prednisolone dose is being studied in relation to MMF and AZA in cHP patients, not specifically in relation to treating hypersensitivity pneumonitis."
20836940,Prednisolone treats juvenile idiopathic arthritis,1101,"Here, we report the case of an 8-year-old girl with a 5-year history of multiple subcutaneous nodules on her extremities and a right wrist joint contracture who had been previously diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and treated with salazosulfapyridine, low-dose prednisolone (PSL) and methotrexate.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats juvenile idiopathic arthritis' supported by the sentence: 'Here, we report the case of an 8-year-old girl with a 5-year history of multiple subcutaneous nodules on her extremities and a right wrist joint contracture who had been previously diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and treated with salazosulfapyridine, low-dose prednisolone (PSL) and methotrexate.'?","Yes, it is supported. The given sentence mentions a case of a patient with juvenile idiopathic arthritis who was treated with low-dose prednisolone (PSL), which implies that prednisolone is used as a treatment for this condition."
20612701,Prednisolone treats myocarditis,1102,This is a case of EGPA relapse presenting as myocarditis despite treatment with prednisolone.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats myocarditis' supported by the sentence: 'This is a case of EGPA relapse presenting as myocarditis despite treatment with prednisolone.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported. The statement suggests that despite treatment with prednisolone, a patient experienced a relapse of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) that presented as myocarditis. This implies that prednisolone may not always effectively treat myocarditis associated with EGPA, but it doesn't necessarily mean that prednisolone has no therapeutic effect on myocarditis. It's important to note that individual patient responses can vary, and other factors could have influenced this particular patient's outcome."
17604301,Prednisolone treats cataract,1103,"Her visual acuity remained stable, despite development of a cataract from prednisolone therapy.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats cataract' supported by the sentence: 'Her visual acuity remained stable, despite development of a cataract from prednisolone therapy.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because it suggests that while prednisolone therapy may cause cataracts (as indicated by 'development of a cataract'), it does not necessarily lead to a decrease in visual acuity (as indicated by 'visual acuity remained stable'). This implies that prednisolone may not be directly treating the cataracts (because they still developed), but it is not causing the expected worsening of symptoms (stable visual acuity)."
17312178,Prednisolone treats type 2 diabetes mellitus,1104,"In this study, we hypothesized that concomitant administration of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin and prednisolone in men at high risk to develop type 2 diabetes could protect against the GC-induced diabetogenic effects.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats type 2 diabetes mellitus' supported by the sentence: 'In this study, we hypothesized that concomitant administration of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin and prednisolone in men at high risk to develop type 2 diabetes could protect against the GC-induced diabetogenic effects.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because it suggests that prednisolone may have diabetogenic effects when administered alone in men at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes. However, when administered concomitantly with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor like sitagliptin, it may not induce these diabetogenic effects. This implies that prednisolone does not directly treat Type 2 diabetes but its effects can be managed when used with other medications like sitagliptin."
17184322,Prednisolone treats croup,1105,"Although common practice, evidence to support treatment of croup with prednisolone is scant.",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats croup' supported by the sentence: 'Although common practice, evidence to support treatment of croup with prednisolone is scant.'?","No, it is not directly nor indirectly supported. The statement suggests that while prednisolone is commonly used for treating croup, there is limited scientific evidence supporting its use."
16852549,Prednisolone treats mature T-cell and NK-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma,1106,"Treatment of peripheral T cell lymphoma with an intensive protocol ACEP (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and prednisolone) and ifosfamide showing an important response and overall survival rates.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats mature T-cell and NK-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma' supported by the sentence: 'Treatment of peripheral T cell lymphoma with an intensive protocol ACEP (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and prednisolone) and ifosfamide showing an important response and overall survival rates.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported, as the sentence mentions Prednisolone as part of a treatment protocol for a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which aligns with the statement about Prednisolone treating certain types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, it's important to note that this doesn't directly prove that Prednisolone alone is effective, as it's used in combination with other drugs in the treatment protocol."
16360878,Prednisolone treats ophthalmic herpes zoster,1107,"Herpes zoster ophthalmicus was suspected and treatment with i.v. acyclovir and prednisolone was commenced, which led to a gradual improvement of the clinical condition.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats ophthalmic herpes zoster' supported by the sentence: 'Herpes zoster ophthalmicus was suspected and treatment with i.v. acyclovir and prednisolone was commenced, which led to a gradual improvement of the clinical condition.'?","Yes, the statement does provide some level of support for the idea that Prednisolone is used in the treatment of ophthalmic herpes zoster (herpes zoster ophthalmicus). However, it's important to note that this is an observational statement, not a controlled study, so it doesn't prove a causal relationship between Prednisolone and improvement in clinical condition. It could be that the improvement was due to the i.v. acyclovir, to Prednisolone, to both, or to some other factor not mentioned in the statement."
15441636,Prednisolone treats lipoma,1108,"Lipomas responded with less lipolysis to isoproterenol than subcutaneous fat during microdialysis, and prednisolone treatment increased lipolysis in both lipomas and subcutaneous fat.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats lipoma' supported by the sentence: 'Lipomas responded with less lipolysis to isoproterenol than subcutaneous fat during microdialysis, and prednisolone treatment increased lipolysis in both lipomas and subcutaneous fat.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. The statement suggests that prednisolone can increase lipolysis (the breakdown of fat) in both lipomas (benign fatty tumors) and subcutaneous fat, which implies that it could potentially have a treating effect on lipomas, as reducing the size of a tumor often involves breaking down its constituent cells. However, it's important to note that this is a indirect inference, as the original statement does not explicitly say that prednisolone treats lipomas, but rather it suggests a potential mechanism for how it might do so."
15369817,Prednisolone treats pericarditis,1109,Treatment with prednisolone improved the pericarditis and motor nerve disturbance and the treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin improved the sensory nerve disturbance.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats pericarditis' supported by the sentence: 'Treatment with prednisolone improved the pericarditis and motor nerve disturbance and the treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin improved the sensory nerve disturbance.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported because treatment of pericarditis with Prednisolone is mentioned as effective, but it does not directly state that Prednisolone is used to treat pericarditis specifically in a triple formulation, nor does it mention sensory nerve disturbance being treated with Prednisolone, as it is in the case of intravenous immunoglobulin in this example."
15104714,Prednisolone treats pulmonary eosinophilia,1110,"Airway macrophage median percentage of red-hued area in stained sputum cytospin preparations was assessed by means of image analysis from (1) subjects with mild-to-severe asthma, subjects with nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, and healthy control subjects; (2) subjects with eosinophilic severe asthma after treatment with prednisolone; and (3) subject with noneosinophilic asthma before corticosteroid withdrawal.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats pulmonary eosinophilia' supported by the sentence: 'Airway macrophage median percentage of red-hued area in stained sputum cytospin preparations was assessed by means of image analysis from (1) subjects with mild-to-severe asthma, subjects with nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, and healthy control subjects; (2) subjects with eosinophilic severe asthma after treatment with prednisolone; and (3) subject with noneosinophilic asthma before corticosteroid withdrawal.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because the mention of prednisolone treatment in subjects with eosinophilic severe asthma suggests a potential therapeutic effect on eosinophilic conditions, such as pulmonary eosinophilia, which is often associated with asthma. However, it's important to note that this is an inference based on a related context, not a direct statement about prednisolone's effect on pulmonary eosinophilia."
14992803,Prednisolone treats aplastic anemia,1111,"We report a case of subcutaneous abscess caused by Nocardia farcinica in a 44-year-old man, who had been treated with systemic prednisolone and cyclosporin for aplastic anemia.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats aplastic anemia' supported by the sentence: 'We report a case of subcutaneous abscess caused by Nocardia farcinica in a 44-year-old man, who had been treated with systemic prednisolone and cyclosporin for aplastic anemia.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. The patient in question was being treated with prednisolone for aplastic anemia, and developed a subcutaneous abscess caused by Nocardia farcinica, which suggests that prednisolone may not have been entirely effective in treating the aplastic anemia, as it did not prevent the infection. However, this does not necessarily mean that prednisolone is not effective in treating aplastic anemia, as there could be other factors at play, such as the patient's immune system status, dosage, duration, etc."
14742554,Prednisolone treats psoriasis,1112,Genetically determined coincidence of Kaposi sarcoma and psoriasis in an HIV-negative patient after prednisolone treatment.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats psoriasis' supported by the sentence: 'Genetically determined coincidence of Kaposi sarcoma and psoriasis in an HIV-negative patient after prednisolone treatment.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported, as it suggests that prednisolone treatment is associated with an occurrence of a condition (Kaposi sarcoma) in a patient with psoriasis, implying that prednisolone might have an effect on psoriasis, although not directly treating it in this case."
14676056,Prednisolone treats habitual spontaneous abortion,1113,Prednisolone Trial: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of prednisolone for women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage and raised levels of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells in the endometrium.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats habitual spontaneous abortion' supported by the sentence: 'Prednisolone Trial: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of prednisolone for women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage and raised levels of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells in the endometrium.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported because prednisolone is being studied as a potential treatment for women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage who have raised levels of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells in the endometrium, which suggests that prednisolone might be useful in treating recurrent miscarriage, a form of habitual spontaneous abortion. However, it's important to note that this study is still ongoing, so any definitive conclusions would be premature."
14345678,Prednisolone treats thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,1114,"The second was a 6-year-old boy with acquired relapsing TTP previously managed with plasmapheresis and prednisolone, who presented with a third relapse that was treated with plasmapheresis and rituximab; he remains in remission 17 months after treatment.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura' supported by the sentence: 'The second was a 6-year-old boy with acquired relapsing TTP previously managed with plasmapheresis and prednisolone, who presented with a third relapse that was treated with plasmapheresis and rituximab; he remains in remission 17 months after treatment.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because it mentions a case of a patient with TTP who was previously managed with prednisolone, implying that prednisolone was used as a treatment for TTP in that case."
14012190,Prednisolone treats angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma,1115,"Three months later, AILD relapsed in spite of prednisolone treatment.",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma' supported by the sentence: 'Three months later, AILD relapsed in spite of prednisolone treatment.'?","No, it is not directly or indirectly supported by that sentence. The relapse of a disease despite treatment does not confirm that the treatment is effective against it, but rather suggests that it may not be sufficient on its own, or that the disease is particularly aggressive or resistant to treatment."
13758030,Prednisolone treats optic neuritis,1116,Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis induced by high-dose prednisolone in a young woman with optic neuritis owing to disseminated encephalomyelitis.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats optic neuritis' supported by the sentence: 'Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis induced by high-dose prednisolone in a young woman with optic neuritis owing to disseminated encephalomyelitis.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported because it mentions prednisolone being used in a case of optic neuritis, even though it's in the context of a side effect (acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis) from high-dose prednisolone."
13566191,Prednisolone treats follicular lymphoma,1117,"The addition of rituximab to cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (CVP) for advanced follicular lymphoma increases median time to progression by 17 months.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats follicular lymphoma' supported by the sentence: 'The addition of rituximab to cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (CVP) for advanced follicular lymphoma increases median time to progression by 17 months.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because it mentions that prednisolone is used in combination with other drugs for treating advanced follicular lymphoma, which suggests its efficacy in treating this type of cancer, even though it does not explicitly state that prednisolone alone can treat follicular lymphoma."
13327146,Prednisolone treats allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,1118,"Here 2 cases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in a family (brother and sister), treated with prednisolone with complete remission are reported.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis' supported by the sentence: 'Here 2 cases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in a family (brother and sister), treated with prednisolone with complete remission are reported.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported, as it mentions two cases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis that were treated with prednisolone with complete remission, suggesting that prednisolone may be an effective treatment for this condition."
13311736,Prednisolone treats neoplasm,1119,FDG-PET was performed in rats bearing BCG granulomas or tumors before and after prednisolone treatment.,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats neoplasm' supported by the sentence: 'FDG-PET was performed in rats bearing BCG granulomas or tumors before and after prednisolone treatment.'?,"No, it is not directly supported because treating tumors with prednisolone does not necessarily mean that prednisolone is effective for treating all types of neoplasms (abnormal growths that may be benign or malignant). The statement also does not provide information about whether prednisolone has any effect on the growth of tumors, which is what one would expect when treating a neoplasm (abnormal growth). The statement only indicates that FDG-PET scans were conducted on rats with granulomas (small nodular inflammations) or tumors before and after prednisolone treatment, but it does not provide data on the outcomes of these treatments, such as reduced size of tumors, absence of tumors, etc."
12767794,Prednisolone treats pneumonia,1120,"After recovering from pneumonia, she was treated initially with prednisolone, 30 mg/day, and remained well until she developed hemoptysis at age 34 years.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats pneumonia' supported by the sentence: 'After recovering from pneumonia, she was treated initially with prednisolone, 30 mg/day, and remained well until she developed hemoptysis at age 34 years.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. The given sentence suggests that prednisolone was used in the treatment of a patient who had recovered from pneumonia and remained well until a later age. This implies that prednisolone might have contributed to her recovery or maintenance of health after pneumonia, although it doesn't directly state that prednisolone is a treatment for pneumonia itself."
12190701,Prednisolone treats castration-resistant prostate carcinoma,1121,Fifteen patients 60 to 80 years old (a mean of 72 years) with hormone-refractory prostate cancer were treated with low dose prednisolone.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats castration-resistant prostate carcinoma' supported by the sentence: 'Fifteen patients 60 to 80 years old (a mean of 72 years) with hormone-refractory prostate cancer were treated with low dose prednisolone.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported because both statements refer to the use of prednisolone in treating hormone-refractory, which is a type of castration-resistant, prostate cancer in older male patients, without specifying a particular dosage regimen that would contradict this connection."
11988157,Prednisolone treats diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,1122,"CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) has been the standard chemotherapy regimen used for diffuse large cell lymphomas for over 30 years.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats diffuse large B-cell lymphoma' supported by the sentence: 'CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) has been the standard chemotherapy regimen used for diffuse large cell lymphomas for over 30 years.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported.

However, it's important to note that this is a case study of six patients, not a large-scale clinical trial, so it doesn't definitively prove that prednisolone is an effective treatment for KD. It does, however, suggest that further research into this area might be warranted."
11813573,Prednisolone treats focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,1124,"RESULTS: Of 136 patients with primary FSGS and nephrotic range proteinuria, 76 (56%) were treated with prednisolone and of this group, 59% were treated with additional immunosuppression.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats focal segmental glomerulosclerosis' supported by the sentence: 'RESULTS: Of 136 patients with primary FSGS and nephrotic range proteinuria, 76 (56%) were treated with prednisolone and of this group, 59% were treated with additional immunosuppression.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because it mentions that prednisolone was used to treat primary FSGS with nephrotic range proteinuria, but it does not directly state that prednisolone treats focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Additionally, it mentions that additional immunosuppression was used in a majority of cases, which suggests a more complex treatment approach for FSGS."
11810617,Prednisolone treats congenital adrenal hyperplasia,1125,"METHODS: Growth parameters of twelve children (8 m, 4 f) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia were retrospectively studied while on treatment with prednisolone (PR) earlier and then hydrocortisone (HC) after it became freely available in India.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats congenital adrenal hyperplasia' supported by the sentence: 'METHODS: Growth parameters of twelve children (8 m, 4 f) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia were retrospectively studied while on treatment with prednisolone (PR) earlier and then hydrocortisone (HC) after it became freely available in India.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because it mentions that growth parameters of children with congenital adrenal hyperplasia were studied while on treatment with prednisolone, implying that prednisolone is used to treat this condition.

The research shows that when patients diagnosed with Temporal Arteritis have an increased YKL-40 serum level compared to healthy age-matched controls, treatment using Prednisolone results in a significant decrease in YKL-40 levels after one month. This suggests that Prednisolone could be an effective treatment for Temporal Arteritis as it helps normalize YKL-40 levels in these patients. However, further research would be required to establish a direct causal relationship between Prednisolone treatment and improvement in Temporal Arteritis symptoms."
7900659,Prednisolone treats polymyalgia rheumatica,1176,Most patients with PMR had normal serum YKL-40 levels (median 158 microg/liter) and had no changes in the serum YKL-40 levels during prednisolone treatment.,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats polymyalgia rheumatica' supported by the sentence: 'Most patients with PMR had normal serum YKL-40 levels (median 158 microg/liter) and had no changes in the serum YKL-40 levels during prednisolone treatment.'?,"No, it is not directly supported because there is no mention of Prednisolone treating polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) in the provided sentence.

7430895,Prednisolone treats asthma,1186,"Interleukin-5 mRNA was detected in all asthmatics before prednisolone therapy; however, after prednisolone therapy, IL-5 mRNA was only detected in non-GCS-responsive BHR asthmatics.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats asthma' supported by the sentence: 'Interleukin-5 mRNA was detected in all asthmatics before prednisolone therapy; however, after prednisolone therapy, IL-5 mRNA was only detected in non-GCS-responsive BHR asthmatics.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. The presence of Interleukin-5 (IL-5) mRNA before prednisolone therapy suggests that prednisolone may have an effect on IL-5, which is associated with asthma. After prednisolone therapy, IL-5 mRNA is still present in non-GCS-responsive BHR asthmatics, suggesting that prednisolone may not be as effective in treating this subset of asthmatics. Therefore, prednisolone can be said to treat asthma, but its effectiveness may vary depending on the individual's responsiveness to glucocorticoid steroids (GCS)."
7417999,Prednisolone treats IgA glomerulonephritis,1187,"Combined therapy with prednisolone, azathioprine, heparin-warfarin, and dipyridamole for paediatric patients with severe IgA nephropathy--is it relevant for adult patients?",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats IgA glomerulonephritis' supported by the sentence: 'Combined therapy with prednisolone, azathioprine, heparin-warfarin, and dipyridamole for paediatric patients with severe IgA nephropathy--is it relevant for adult patients?'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported, as it suggests that Prednisolone can be used in treating severe cases of IgA nephropathy, which is a type of glomerulonephritis, in paediatric patients, implying that it may also be relevant for adult patients, although it is not specifically mentioned in the provided context."

Also, there is no mention of dissociative amnesia in the provided statement."
15602187,Hydrocortisone treats Hypoxemia,1197,All inhibitors prevented the rise in cortisol secretion usually observed in hypoxic dogs.,True,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats Hypoxemia' supported by the sentence: 'All inhibitors prevented the rise in cortisol secretion usually observed in hypoxic dogs.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported. The statement suggests that hypoxic dogs treated with certain inhibitors did not experience an increase in cortisol secretion, which is typically seen in hypoxic conditions. Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland, and hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of this hormone often used to treat various conditions, including hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood). Therefore, if these inhibitors prevent an increase in natural cortisol, it could be hypothesized that administering hydrocortisone might have a similar effect, helping to regulate cortisol levels during hypoxic conditions. However, this is an interpretation based on a general understanding of hormonal regulation, and further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis."

The provided statement suggests that prednisolone is used in treating gastric sarcoidosis but the patient was dependent on it. The addition of azathioprine improved the condition, indicating that other treatments (like azathioprine) can be beneficial in managing prednisolone-dependent cases. This is indirectly supportive of the idea that prednisolone affects colitis because sarcoidosis and colitis can both involve inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, and treatments for one may also be relevant for the other. However, it's important to note that this is an inference based on related conditions; for direct evidence on prednisolone's effect on colitis, studies specifically addressing this question would need to be examined."

The sentence suggests that prednisolone can improve eosinophilia (a condition often associated with COPD) within a certain time frame. However, it also mentions that some patients with splenomegaly did not respond well to corticosteroid treatment (which prednisolone is a part of), indicating potential limitations in its effectiveness. Therefore, while there's some support for an indirect relationship between prednisolone and COPD management, it's not a direct correlation and further research would be needed to make a definitive conclusion."

8017438,Hydrocortisone related to Insulin resistance,284,"These findings demonstrate 2 types of adrenal insufficiency with different clinical pictures: Type 1 is characterized by cortisol deficiency with hypoglycaemia, low corticoid levels and a low cortisol secretion rate; Type 2 shows aldosterone deficiency with prominent salt loss.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to Insulin resistance' supported by the sentence: 'These findings demonstrate 2 types of adrenal insufficiency with different clinical pictures: Type 1 is characterized by cortisol deficiency with hypoglycaemia, low corticoid levels and a low cortisol secretion rate; Type 2 shows aldosterone deficiency with prominent salt loss.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, and corticosteroids play a role in glucose metabolism, which is relevant to insulin resistance. However, the given sentence does not directly mention Hydrocortisone, Insulin, or Resistance, so it's an indirect association based on the broader context of corticosteroids and glucose metabolism."
7919367,Hydrocortisone related to adrenocortical insufficiency,285,"November, a period of reproductive quiescence in the southern hemisphere, with new antler growth and rapid weight gain, is associated with higher mean plasma cortisol concentrations and a greater responsiveness to exogenous ACTH.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to adrenocortical insufficiency' supported by the sentence: 'November, a period of reproductive quiescence in the southern hemisphere, with new antler growth and rapid weight gain, is associated with higher mean plasma cortisol concentrations and a greater responsiveness to exogenous ACTH.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid that is often used to treat conditions related to the adrenal gland such as adrenocortical insufficiency. The sentence you provided mentions higher mean plasma cortisol concentrations and a greater responsiveness to exogenous ACTH during November in the southern hemisphere. Cortisol is a hormone produced by the adrenal gland in response to stress, including physical stress such as new antler growth and rapid weight gain. Therefore, higher cortisol levels could indicate a more active adrenal gland, which is relevant to conditions like adrenocortical insufficiency where the adrenal gland is not functioning properly. However, this is an indirect correlation as it doesn't directly mention Hydrocortisone or adrenocortical insufficiency."

7182905,Hydrocortisone related to obesity disorder,287,The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the key physiological systems that counterbalances this systemic inflammation through changes in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol.,True,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to obesity disorder' supported by the sentence: 'The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is one of the key physiological systems that counterbalances this systemic inflammation through changes in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol.'?,"Yes, there is an indirect relationship between Hydrocortisone and obesity disorder as per the given sentence. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, which is released by the adrenal gland in response to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation from the pituitary gland, as part of the HPA axis. Systemic inflammation can impact the HPA axis, leading to changes in ACTH and cortisol levels, which in turn can contribute to metabolic disorders such as obesity due to cortisol's role in fat distribution, appetite regulation, and glucose metabolism. However, this is a complex process with multiple factors involved, so further research is required to fully understand the relationship between HPA axis dysregulation, Hydrocortisone, and obesity."
24445107,Hydrocortisone related to Inflammation,288,"The 5 dpf hypoxic exposure also elicited transient increases in whole body cortisol and in crf, uts1, and hsd20b2 expression, key regulators of the endocrine stress response.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to Inflammation' supported by the sentence: 'The 5 dpf hypoxic exposure also elicited transient increases in whole body cortisol and in crf, uts1, and hsd20b2 expression, key regulators of the endocrine stress response.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. The mention of cortisol, a key regulator of the endocrine stress response, in relation to a hypoxic exposure that elicits an increase in cortisol levels suggests a connection to inflammation. Cortisol is known to have anti-inflammatory effects in the body, so an increase in cortisol could be a response to manage inflammation. However, this is an inference and not explicitly stated in the provided sentence."
24030854,Hydrocortisone related to Hypoxemia,289,"At multiple regression analyses, HOMA-IR on admission in the IR group significantly correlated with thyroid-stimulating hormone, glucagon, and cortisol.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to Hypoxemia' supported by the sentence: 'At multiple regression analyses, HOMA-IR on admission in the IR group significantly correlated with thyroid-stimulating hormone, glucagon, and cortisol.'?","Yes, there is an indirect relationship between hydrocortisone and hypoxemia in this context. The sentence you provided mentions a correlation between cortisol (a hormone produced in response to stress, which hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of) with HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) on admission in a group with insulin resistance (IR). Insulin resistance is a risk factor for hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood). Therefore, there is an indirect relationship between hydrocortisone (used as a treatment for various conditions) and hypoxemia through insulin resistance. However, it is essential to note that this relationship is not direct but rather mediated through other factors such as insulin resistance."
12533519,Hydrocortisone related to Insulin resistance,290,"The suppression of the anti-inflammatory effects of cortisol as a result of states of excessive stress leads to hypercatabolic diseases such as AIDS, sepsis and toxic shock syndrome and protein calorie malnutrition (NAIDS).",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to Insulin resistance' supported by the sentence: 'The suppression of the anti-inflammatory effects of cortisol as a result of states of excessive stress leads to hypercatabolic diseases such as AIDS, sepsis and toxic shock syndrome and protein calorie malnutrition (NAIDS).'?","Yes, there is an indirect relationship between Hydrocortisone and Insulin resistance based on the provided sentence. Hydrocortisone, a type of corticosteroid, has anti-inflammatory effects, which can be suppressed due to excessive stress, leading to hypercatabolic diseases such as AIDS, sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and protein calorie malnutrition (NAIDS).

Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) is a chronic condition where individuals have a deficiency in cortisol, leading to elevated levels of androgens in utero. Hydrocortisone is a medication often used to treat CAH, as it helps to replace the missing cortisol. If not treated, CAH can lead to a number of complications, one of which is hypoxemia, or low oxygen levels in the blood, due to issues with lung development. Therefore, while hydrocortisone itself does not cause hypoxemia, its use in treating CAH can help prevent this complication."

However, this is a complex chain of inference and would require further research to confirm."
11695335,Hydrocortisone affects Hypoxemia,331,"INTRA-CELL CORTISOL: Attention is also focused on the potential implication of cortisol in the genesis of metabolic syndrome, because cortisol is a potent antagonist of the effect of insulin and its presence in excess enhances visceral obesity and insulin resistance.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone affects Hypoxemia' supported by the sentence: 'INTRA-CELL CORTISOL: Attention is also focused on the potential implication of cortisol in the genesis of metabolic syndrome, because cortisol is a potent antagonist of the effect of insulin and its presence in excess enhances visceral obesity and insulin resistance.'?","Yes, there is an indirect connection between hydrocortisone, hypoxemia, and the mentioned sentence about cortisol's role in metabolic syndrome. Here's why:

        1) Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, which can increase blood sugar levels in the body. This is similar to cortisol, a hormone that your body produces naturally in response to stress, also known as the 'stress hormone.'
        2) High blood sugar levels can lead to conditions like insulin resistance, which is mentioned in your provided sentence as a component of metabolic syndrome. Insulin resistance can lead to various health issues, one of which is obesity, particularly in the abdominal area (visceral obesity).
        3) Obesity, especially in the abdominal area, can lead to hypoventilation, a condition characterized by shallow breathing, which in turn can lead to hypoxemia, a state of low oxygen levels in the blood.

        Therefore, while hydrocortisone is not directly mentioned in the provided sentence, its effects on blood sugar levels can contribute to conditions that may lead to hyp"

It is used to decrease inflammation in conditions such as arthritis, lupus, asthma, bronchitis, and many others. So, in a roundabout way, the statement about stressful life events, coping, and cortisol can be linked to Hydrocortisone's effect on inflammation. However, it's important to note that this is a complex relationship involving many factors including the body's natural response to stress and the use of synthetic hormones like Hydrocortisone."

Hydrocortisone is a type of cortisol, a steroid hormone produced in the adrenal gland. It is known that increased levels of cortisol can lead to insulin resistance, which is a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This insulin resistance can also contribute to weight gain or obesity, as insulin plays a role in regulating energy storage and use in the body. Therefore, anything that increases insulin resistance, like high levels of cortisol, could potentially contribute to obesity. The sentence you provided mentions that inhibition of an enzyme that converts cortisone to cortisol could lead to a decrease in gluconeogenesis, which is a process that contributes to high blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes mellitus. If this inhibition also leads to lower levels of cortisol, it could potentially reduce insulin resistance and therefore also have an impact on obesity, although this is not explicitly stated in the sentence."

Hydrocortisone is a form of cortisol, a hormone that helps regulate metabolism, immune response, and stress levels, among other things. In critical illnesses like sepsis or septic shock, as mentioned in your provided statement, there can be an increased demand for cortisol due to severe stress, which can lead to a condition known as Critical Illness-Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency (CIRCI). This condition is marked by an inadequate production of cortisol in relation to demand, which can cause various complications, including metabolic disorders like hyperglycemia, which could potentially contribute to an increased risk of developing conditions like Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in susceptible individuals over time, but more research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis as there's not enough evidence to establish a direct cause-effect relationship between hydrocortisone use in CIRCI patients and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus development."

Synacthen is a synthetic analog of ACTH, a hormone that stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol, among other things. The Synacthen test measures the adrenal glands' response to this stimulation, which can help diagnose conditions like Addison's disease where there is a deficiency in cortisol production. However, Hydrocortisone is a medication used to replace cortisol in people with conditions like Addison's disease, not a cause of toxic shock syndrome."

16963888,Hydrocortisone prevents adrenocortical insufficiency,374,CONCLUSION: We conclude that intravenous stress doses of hydrocortisone lead to a reduction of systemic inflammation and to a potential improvement in the early outcome of patients undergoing off-pump CABG.,True,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone prevents adrenocortical insufficiency' supported by the sentence: 'CONCLUSION: We conclude that intravenous stress doses of hydrocortisone lead to a reduction of systemic inflammation and to a potential improvement in the early outcome of patients undergoing off-pump CABG.'?,"Yes, because hydrocortisone is a type of steroid medication that can prevent inflammation, which is a symptom of adrenocortical insufficiency. The conclusion you provided suggests that hydrocortisone reduces systemic inflammation in patients undergoing off-pump CABG, which could potentially improve their early outcome. Therefore, it supports, at least indirectly, the statement that hydrocortisone prevents adrenocortical insufficiency, as this condition is characterized by a deficiency in corticosteroids, which can lead to inflammation and other symptoms."
