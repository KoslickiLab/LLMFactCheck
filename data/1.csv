9145908,Hydrocortisone causes otitis externa,47,"In conclusion, the reciprocal expression of CYP17 and the transcriptional repressors COUP-TF and DAX-1 indicates that these orphan receptors have a pathophysiologic role in the excessive hormone production in cortisol- and deoxycorticosterone-producing adrenocortical tumors.",False,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes otitis externa' supported by the sentence: 'In conclusion, the reciprocal expression of CYP17 and the transcriptional repressors COUP-TF and DAX-1 indicates that these orphan receptors have a pathophysiologic role in the excessive hormone production in cortisol- and deoxycorticosterone-producing adrenocortical tumors.'?","No, it is not directly supported because there is no explicit mention in this statement about Hydrocortisone causing otitis externa. This statement discusses the role of certain receptors in excessive hormone production in adrenocortical tumors."
8699464,Hydrocortisone causes adrenal cortex neoplasm,48,"The administration of hydrocortisone before tumor inoculation resulted in increased tumor take, reduced mean survival time of mice, and concentration of tumor metastasis in a specific organ (i.e., lung metastasis for Ehrlich hypotetraploid clone 1 tumor, and liver metastasis for Ehrlich hypotetraploid stock and Ehrlich hyperdiploid stock tumors).",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes adrenal cortex neoplasm' supported by the sentence: 'The administration of hydrocortisone before tumor inoculation resulted in increased tumor take, reduced mean survival time of mice, and concentration of tumor metastasis in a specific organ (i.e., lung metastasis for Ehrlich hypotetraploid clone 1 tumor, and liver metastasis for Ehrlich hypotetraploid stock and Ehrlich hyperdiploid stock tumors).'?","Yes, this statement does provide some support for the idea that hydrocortisone could potentially have an impact on tumor growth and metastasis, which could be interpreted as a form of neoplasm (abnormal tissue growth). However, it does not directly state that hydrocortisone causes adrenal cortex neoplasm. It's also important to note that correlation does not imply causation, so further research would be needed to establish a direct cause-effect relationship."
8657746,Hydrocortisone causes neoplasm,49,"Cortisol counteracts the insulin activation of glycogen synthase in muscle, the insulin inhibition of hepatic glucose production and the insulin inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue, leading to the well-established systemic insulin resistance caused by excess cortisol.",False,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes neoplasm' supported by the sentence: 'Cortisol counteracts the insulin activation of glycogen synthase in muscle, the insulin inhibition of hepatic glucose production and the insulin inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue, leading to the well-established systemic insulin resistance caused by excess cortisol.'?","No, this statement does not provide evidence that Hydrocortisone, a specific type of cortisol, directly or indirectly causes neoplasm (a type of cancer). It discusses the effects of cortisol on various metabolic processes, but does not make a connection to neoplasm."
7929803,Hydrocortisone causes Insulin resistance,50,"The amount of N-acetyl D-glucosamine in the zymogen granule membrane was not altered by caerulein acute pancreatitis induced under continuous hydrocortisone treatment, but it was decreased by the administration of L-364,718 over 7 days after pancreatitis induction.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes Insulin resistance' supported by the sentence: 'The amount of N-acetyl D-glucosamine in the zymogen granule membrane was not altered by caerulein acute pancreatitis induced under continuous hydrocortisone treatment, but it was decreased by the administration of L-364,718 over 7 days after pancreatitis induction.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because hydrocortisone did not affect N-acetyl D-glucosamine levels, but L-364,718, a compound known to increase insulin sensitivity, did decrease these levels after pancreatitis induction, suggesting a link between hydrocortisone, zymogen granule membrane changes, and potential insulin resistance. However, this is a complex biological system, and more research would be needed to confirm this relationship directly."
7432490,Hydrocortisone causes pancreatitis,51,"In this study, low-dose methylprednisolone (0.8 mg/kg/day, MP) was used to induce a steroid-resistant lupus nephritis (SR-LN) mouse model in weeks one to four, and a therapeutic steroid dosage (MP 12 mg/kg/day) or a combined PNS (PNS 100 mg/kg/day) treatment was administered from week five to eight.",False,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes pancreatitis' supported by the sentence: 'In this study, low-dose methylprednisolone (0.8 mg/kg/day, MP) was used to induce a steroid-resistant lupus nephritis (SR-LN) mouse model in weeks one to four, and a therapeutic steroid dosage (MP 12 mg/kg/day) or a combined PNS (PNS 100 mg/kg/day) treatment was administered from week five to eight.'?","No, because hydrocortisone is not mentioned in the provided sentence. The steroids mentioned in the sentence are methylprednisolone (MP) and PNS (Pentoxifylline)."
