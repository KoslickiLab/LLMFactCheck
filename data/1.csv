9850315,Hydrocortisone causes dissociative amnesia,44,"Type 2 glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which are occupied by cortisol in humans in times of stress, are thought to be responsible for the glucocorticoid-induced memory impairment.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes dissociative amnesia' supported by the sentence: 'Type 2 glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), which are occupied by cortisol in humans in times of stress, are thought to be responsible for the glucocorticoid-induced memory impairment.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, similar to cortisol, which can bind to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in the brain, potentially leading to memory impairment as suggested in the given sentence. However, it's important to note that this is a complex process involving many factors, and direct causation cannot be inferred from this information alone."
9318796,Hydrocortisone causes adrenocortical insufficiency,45,"Firstly, the GH-mediated increase in cortisol metabolism (mediated via reduced E to F conversion) may precipitate adrenal insufficiency in hypopituitary patients with partial adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency commencing GH therapy.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes adrenocortical insufficiency' supported by the sentence: 'Firstly, the GH-mediated increase in cortisol metabolism (mediated via reduced E to F conversion) may precipitate adrenal insufficiency in hypopituitary patients with partial adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency commencing GH therapy.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid that can be used to treat adrenal insufficiency, which is a condition that can be precipitated in hypopituitary patients with partial adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency commencing GH therapy due to increased cortisol metabolism as mentioned in your provided sentence."
9145908,Hydrocortisone causes otitis externa,46,"From this study it is inferred that the group III steroid betamethasone dipropionate alone heals experimentally induced external otitis more rapidly than hydrocortisone with oxytetracycline, with or without polymyxin B.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes otitis externa' supported by the sentence: 'From this study it is inferred that the group III steroid betamethasone dipropionate alone heals experimentally induced external otitis more rapidly than hydrocortisone with oxytetracycline, with or without polymyxin B.'?","Yes, the statement does provide some support for the idea that hydrocortisone may not be as effective as other steroids, such as betamethasone dipropionate, in treating experimentally induced external otitis. However, it does not directly state that hydrocortisone causes otitis externa. It suggests a comparative less effectiveness of hydrocortisone, but not a causal relationship with otitis externa."
8699464,Hydrocortisone causes adrenal cortex neoplasm,47,"In conclusion, the reciprocal expression of CYP17 and the transcriptional repressors COUP-TF and DAX-1 indicates that these orphan receptors have a pathophysiologic role in the excessive hormone production in cortisol- and deoxycorticosterone-producing adrenocortical tumors.",False,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes adrenal cortex neoplasm' supported by the sentence: 'In conclusion, the reciprocal expression of CYP17 and the transcriptional repressors COUP-TF and DAX-1 indicates that these orphan receptors have a pathophysiologic role in the excessive hormone production in cortisol- and deoxycorticosterone-producing adrenocortical tumors.'?","No, it is not directly supported because it mentions a pathophysiologic role in excessive hormone production in tumors but does not mention any relationship with Hydrocortisone causing adrenal cortex neoplasms."
8657746,Hydrocortisone causes neoplasm,48,"The administration of hydrocortisone before tumor inoculation resulted in increased tumor take, reduced mean survival time of mice, and concentration of tumor metastasis in a specific organ (i.e., lung metastasis for Ehrlich hypotetraploid clone 1 tumor, and liver metastasis for Ehrlich hypotetraploid stock and Ehrlich hyperdiploid stock tumors).",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes neoplasm' supported by the sentence: 'The administration of hydrocortisone before tumor inoculation resulted in increased tumor take, reduced mean survival time of mice, and concentration of tumor metastasis in a specific organ (i.e., lung metastasis for Ehrlich hypotetraploid clone 1 tumor, and liver metastasis for Ehrlich hypotetraploid stock and Ehrlich hyperdiploid stock tumors).'?","Yes, this statement suggests that administering hydrocortisone could potentially promote tumor growth, which aligns with the concept that hydrocortisone could contribute to neoplasms, albeit indirectly."
7929803,Hydrocortisone causes Insulin resistance,49,"Cortisol counteracts the insulin activation of glycogen synthase in muscle, the insulin inhibition of hepatic glucose production and the insulin inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue, leading to the well-established systemic insulin resistance caused by excess cortisol.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes Insulin resistance' supported by the sentence: 'Cortisol counteracts the insulin activation of glycogen synthase in muscle, the insulin inhibition of hepatic glucose production and the insulin inhibition of lipolysis in adipose tissue, leading to the well-established systemic insulin resistance caused by excess cortisol.'?","Yes, the statement suggests that Hydrocortisone, which is a synthetic form of cortisol, could cause insulin resistance through similar mechanisms as cortisol. This is because cortisol is known to counteract the effects of insulin, leading to systemic insulin resistance when present in excess. However, it's important to note that this is an inference based on the given statement, and direct experimental evidence may be needed to confirm this hypothesis."
7432490,Hydrocortisone causes pancreatitis,50,"The amount of N-acetyl D-glucosamine in the zymogen granule membrane was not altered by caerulein acute pancreatitis induced under continuous hydrocortisone treatment, but it was decreased by the administration of L-364,718 over 7 days after pancreatitis induction.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone causes pancreatitis' supported by the sentence: 'The amount of N-acetyl D-glucosamine in the zymogen granule membrane was not altered by caerulein acute pancreatitis induced under continuous hydrocortisone treatment, but it was decreased by the administration of L-364,718 over 7 days after pancreatitis induction.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported because it mentions that hydrocortisone is used in treatment, implying a potential connection to pancreatitis, but it does not directly state that hydrocortisone causes pancreatitis."
24973247,Methylprednisolone causes lupus nephritis,51,"In this study, low-dose methylprednisolone (0.8 mg/kg/day, MP) was used to induce a steroid-resistant lupus nephritis (SR-LN) mouse model in weeks one to four, and a therapeutic steroid dosage (MP 12 mg/kg/day) or a combined PNS (PNS 100 mg/kg/day) treatment was administered from week five to eight.",True,"Is the triple 'Methylprednisolone causes lupus nephritis' supported by the sentence: 'In this study, low-dose methylprednisolone (0.8 mg/kg/day, MP) was used to induce a steroid-resistant lupus nephritis (SR-LN) mouse model in weeks one to four, and a therapeutic steroid dosage (MP 12 mg/kg/day) or a combined PNS (PNS 100 mg/kg/day) treatment was administered from week five to eight.'?","Yes, the statement does provide some support for the idea that methylprednisolone can be associated with lupus nephritis, albeit in a mouse model. The use of methylprednisolone to induce a steroid-resistant lupus nephritis model suggests a link between the two. However, it's important to note that this is a controlled experimental setting and may not directly translate to human conditions or long-term effects."
