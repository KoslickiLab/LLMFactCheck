13885379,mebendazole treats Inactivation,44,Mebendazole induces apoptosis via Bcl-2 inactivation in chemoresistant melanoma cells.,True,Is the triple 'mebendazole treats Inactivation' supported by the sentence: 'Mebendazole induces apoptosis via Bcl-2 inactivation in chemoresistant melanoma cells.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported. The given sentence states that mebendazole induces apoptosis (cell death) in chemoresistant melanoma cells through the inactivation of Bcl-2, which is a protein that inhibits apoptosis. Therefore, mebendazole's effect on Bcl-2 inactivation does support the idea that it can inactivate, and thus treat, certain biological processes related to disease, in this case, in chemoresistant melanoma cells."
12876761,mebendazole treats infertility disorder,45,"The evaluation also highlighted that there were critical issues for the successful implementation of the program such as the issue of educating illiterate mothers, higher involvement of families in the mass treatment process, ability to reach a larger number of school absentees, and overcoming the prejudice against externally funded measures, which are perceived by some of the members of the community as an experiment run by foreigners on the local population and the concern of some parents that anthelmintic drug (mebendazole) might cause sexual sterility.",False,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats infertility disorder' supported by the sentence: 'The evaluation also highlighted that there were critical issues for the successful implementation of the program such as the issue of educating illiterate mothers, higher involvement of families in the mass treatment process, ability to reach a larger number of school absentees, and overcoming the prejudice against externally funded measures, which are perceived by some of the members of the community as an experiment run by foreigners on the local population and the concern of some parents that anthelmintic drug (mebendazole) might cause sexual sterility.'?","No, the statement ""mebendazole treats infertility disorder"" is not directly or indirectly supported by this sentence. The passage discusses challenges in implementing a program related to mebendazole, an anthelmintic drug used to treat parasitic worm infections, but it does not mention or imply any effect of mebendazole on fertility or infertility."
11280026,mebendazole treats Increased reactive oxygen species production,46,"A comparative study of albendazole and mebendazole-induced, time-dependent oxidative stress.",False,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats Increased reactive oxygen species production' supported by the sentence: 'A comparative study of albendazole and mebendazole-induced, time-dependent oxidative stress.'?","No, it is not directly supported because the given title talks about a comparison between oxidative stress induced by two drugs, but it does not mention anything about increased reactive oxygen species production being treated by mebendazole."
11046187,mebendazole treats poisoning,47,"Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).",Undefined,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats poisoning' supported by the sentence: 'Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).'?","The statement suggests that mebendazole (MBZ) has toxic effects on cells at certain concentrations, but it does not explicitly state that mebendazole is used to treat poisoning. Therefore, I would say that the statement does not directly support the claim that mebendazole treats poisoning, but it could indirectly support the idea that mebendazole has toxic effects, which could potentially be useful in treating certain types of poisoning under specific circumstances. However, this is an interpretation based on the information provided, and further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis."
11046186,mebendazole treats cytotoxicity,48,"Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).",True,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats cytotoxicity' supported by the sentence: 'Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).'?","Yes, this statement does support that mebendazole (MBZ) has a concentration-dependent effect on cell toxicity, which can be interpreted as a form of indirect support for the statement that mebendazole can treat cytotoxicity, as higher concentrations appear to reduce cell viability in this context."
9926628,mebendazole treats Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung,49,Oral administration of MZ in mice elicited a strong antitumor effect in a s.c. model and reduced lung colonies in experimentally induced lung metastasis without any toxicity when compared with paclitaxel-treated mice.,Undefined,Is the triple 'mebendazole treats Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung' supported by the sentence: 'Oral administration of MZ in mice elicited a strong antitumor effect in a s.c. model and reduced lung colonies in experimentally induced lung metastasis without any toxicity when compared with paclitaxel-treated mice.'?,"Indirectly, because it shows that mebendazole has antitumor effects in a mouse model, but it doesn't specifically mention Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung."
9926626,mebendazole treats spindle assembly,50,"MZ induces abnormal spindle formation in mitotic cancer cells and enhances the depolymerization of tubulin, but the efficacy of depolymerization by MZ is lower than that by nocodazole.",True,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats spindle assembly' supported by the sentence: 'MZ induces abnormal spindle formation in mitotic cancer cells and enhances the depolymerization of tubulin, but the efficacy of depolymerization by MZ is lower than that by nocodazole.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. The statement mentions that mebendazole (MZ) causes abnormal spindle formation and enhances tubulin depolymerization, which aligns with the concept of MZ treating spindle assembly issues. However, it doesn't explicitly state that MZ treats spindle assembly, hence it's an indirect support."
9926624,mebendazole treats Apoptosis,51,The anthelmintic drug mebendazole induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis by depolymerizing tubulin in non-small cell lung cancer cells.,True,Is the triple 'mebendazole treats Apoptosis' supported by the sentence: 'The anthelmintic drug mebendazole induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis by depolymerizing tubulin in non-small cell lung cancer cells.'?,"Yes, this statement does support the claim that mebendazole can induce apoptosis, as mentioned in your proposed triple statement. The mechanism suggested in this statement is through depolymerizing tubulin in non-small cell lung cancer cells, which leads to mitotic arrest and eventually apoptosis. Therefore, it can be said that there is a direct connection, as the mechanism of action is provided in this statement."
