12653424,Prednisolone treats hypertensive disorder,33,We report two cases of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome that developed ARF following captopril (an ACEI) treatment for prednisolone-induced hypertension.,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats hypertensive disorder' supported by the sentence: 'We report two cases of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome that developed ARF following captopril (an ACEI) treatment for prednisolone-induced hypertension.'?,"No, it is not directly supported because it does not mention that prednisolone treats hypertension, but it could be interpreted as indirect support since prednisolone is used to manage a condition (prednisolone-induced hypertension) that led to another condition (hypertensive disorder) being treated with captopril, which then caused ARF in these patients with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome."
12012071,Prednisolone treats hyperglycemia,34,"However, prednisolone caused hyperglycemia even at a reduced dose of 10 mg/day.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats hyperglycemia' supported by the sentence: 'However, prednisolone caused hyperglycemia even at a reduced dose of 10 mg/day.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. The sentence suggests that Prednisolone causes hyperglycemia, which contradicts the statement that it treats hyperglycemia."
11394683,Prednisolone treats osteoporosis,35,"Effect of D-003, a mixture of very high molecular weight aliphatic acids, on prednisolone-induced osteoporosis in Sprague-Dawley rats.",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats osteoporosis' supported by the sentence: 'Effect of D-003, a mixture of very high molecular weight aliphatic acids, on prednisolone-induced osteoporosis in Sprague-Dawley rats.'?","No, this statement does not directly support that Prednisolone treats osteoporosis. Instead, it discusses the effect of another substance (D-003) on prednisolone-induced osteoporosis in rats."
10735861,Prednisolone treats contact dermatitis,36,CONTACT DERMATITIS DUE TO TOPICAL HYDROCORTISONE AND PREDNISOLONE.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats contact dermatitis' supported by the sentence: 'CONTACT DERMATITIS DUE TO TOPICAL HYDROCORTISONE AND PREDNISOLONE.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported. The sentence mentions that Prednisolone can cause Contact Dermatitis, which suggests that it is used to treat Contact Dermatitis, as treatments often involve managing symptoms caused by a substance. However, it's important to note that this is a complex medical topic and a direct professional consultation is recommended for medical advice."
9924414,Prednisolone treats Marchiafava-Bignami disease,37,We carried out two experiments using a prednisolone (pred)-induced bone loss model in male (10-week-old) Fischer rats.,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats Marchiafava-Bignami disease' supported by the sentence: 'We carried out two experiments using a prednisolone (pred)-induced bone loss model in male (10-week-old) Fischer rats.'?,"No, it is not directly or indirectly supported because there is no mention of Marchiafava-Bignami disease in your provided sentence, which is about an experiment involving prednisolone and bone loss in rats, not about treatments for specific diseases like Marchiafava-Bignami disease."
8757881,Prednisolone treats systemic lupus erythematosus,38,"In inactive SLE induced by prednisolone therapy, the invariant Valpha24JalphaQ TCR could be detected in DN Valpha24+ T cells from all the patients and dominated in most of the patients.",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats systemic lupus erythematosus' supported by the sentence: 'In inactive SLE induced by prednisolone therapy, the invariant Valpha24JalphaQ TCR could be detected in DN Valpha24+ T cells from all the patients and dominated in most of the patients.'?","No, this statement does not provide direct support for the claim that Prednisolone treats systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The sentence discusses the detection of a specific type of T-cell receptor (TCR) in patients with inactive SLE after prednisolone therapy, but it does not establish a causal relationship between prednisolone treatment and improvement of SLE symptoms, which is necessary for supporting the claim that Prednisolone is a treatment for this condition."
27073884,Hydrocortisone treats atopic eczema,39,"We report the case of a 41-year-old nonatopic women with a previous history of eczematous reaction due to hydrocortisone who suffered worsening of her perennial rhinitis in association with perinasal dermatitis from the use of budesonide in nasal spray form, and stomatitis and pharyngitis due to budesonide in a bronchial inhaler.",False,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats atopic eczema' supported by the sentence: 'We report the case of a 41-year-old nonatopic women with a previous history of eczematous reaction due to hydrocortisone who suffered worsening of her perennial rhinitis in association with perinasal dermatitis from the use of budesonide in nasal spray form, and stomatitis and pharyngitis due to budesonide in a bronchial inhaler.'?","No, this statement does not provide direct support for hydrocortisone treating atopic eczema, as it discusses an adverse reaction to budesonide, not hydrocortisone, in an individual with perennial rhinitis, perinasal dermatitis, stomatitis, and pharyngitis, not specifically atopic eczema."
26275693,Hydrocortisone treats systemic lupus erythematosus,40,Formation of covalent adducts between cortisol and 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone and protein: possible role in the pathogenesis of cortisol toxicity and systemic lupus erythematosus.,True,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats systemic lupus erythematosus' supported by the sentence: 'Formation of covalent adducts between cortisol and 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone and protein: possible role in the pathogenesis of cortisol toxicity and systemic lupus erythematosus.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported because it mentions a possible role for cortisol (a form of hydrocortisone) in systemic lupus erythematosus, but it does not explicitly state that hydrocortisone is used to treat this condition."
25645505,Hydrocortisone treats Shock,41,[Anaphylaxis-like shock caused by hydrocortisone and prednisolone sodium succinate in an asthmatic patient].,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats Shock' supported by the sentence: '[Anaphylaxis-like shock caused by hydrocortisone and prednisolone sodium succinate in an asthmatic patient].'?,"No, it is not directly supported because the given sentence discusses a case of anaphylactic shock caused by hydrocortisone and prednisolone sodium succinate, which suggests a possible adverse reaction to these medications, rather than their therapeutic effect in treating shock."
25268311,Hydrocortisone treats autoimmune disease,42,"In recent years, growing evidence has shown that 25-HC performs a critical function in the etiology of cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.",False,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats autoimmune disease' supported by the sentence: 'In recent years, growing evidence has shown that 25-HC performs a critical function in the etiology of cancer, infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.'?","No, it is not directly supported because hydrocortisone is mentioned in the statement, not 25-HC which is a metabolite of cholesterol and not a form of hydrocortisone. However, it is indirectly related because both hydrocortisone and 25-HC have roles in autoimmune disorders."
18446972,Hydrocortisone treats congenital adrenal hyperplasia,43,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a chronic condition and individuals are exposed to elevated androgen levels in utero as a result of the endogenous cortisol deficiency.,True,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats congenital adrenal hyperplasia' supported by the sentence: 'Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a chronic condition and individuals are exposed to elevated androgen levels in utero as a result of the endogenous cortisol deficiency.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported. The statement that individuals with CAH have elevated androgen levels in utero due to endogenous cortisol deficiency suggests that treating this cortisol deficiency, as Hydrocortisone does, could help manage the condition. However, it doesn't explicitly state that Hydrocortisone is used to treat CAH, hence it's an indirect support."
16762875,Hydrocortisone treats congestive heart failure,44,"In multivariate regression analysis, cortisol was an independent predictor of Vo2peak (R2 = 0.365, F = 12.5, SE = 3.4; p<=0.001) and Ve/Vco2 slope (R2 = 0.154; F = 8.5; SE = 5.96; p = 0.006), after accounting for age, body mass index, sex, CHF etiology, creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ACTH in all patients.",False,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats congestive heart failure' supported by the sentence: 'In multivariate regression analysis, cortisol was an independent predictor of Vo2peak (R2 = 0.365, F = 12.5, SE = 3.4; p<=0.001) and Ve/Vco2 slope (R2 = 0.154; F = 8.5; SE = 5.96; p = 0.006), after accounting for age, body mass index, sex, CHF etiology, creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction, and ACTH in all patients.'?","No, this statement does not provide direct support for the claim that Hydrocortisone treats congestive heart failure (CHF). The statement is about a statistical correlation between cortisol levels (a hormone that Hydrocortisone can affect) and certain physiological measures (Vo2peak and Ve/Vco2 slope) in patients with CHF. It does not claim that Hydrocortisone is a treatment for CHF."
16290606,Hydrocortisone treats diabetes mellitus,45,"Increased cortisol results in diabetes, hence quelling the activity of 11betaHSD1 has been thought of as an effective approach for the treatment of diabetes.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats diabetes mellitus' supported by the sentence: 'Increased cortisol results in diabetes, hence quelling the activity of 11betaHSD1 has been thought of as an effective approach for the treatment of diabetes.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. The statement suggests that increased levels of cortisol, which is produced by an enzyme called 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11betaHSD1), can lead to diabetes. Therefore, inhibiting the activity of 11betaHSD1 could potentially help in treating diabetes. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, so reducing its use could help manage diabetes by reducing cortisol levels. However, this is a complex physiological process with many factors, so it's important to consult with healthcare professionals for medical advice."

The given sentence suggests that long-term use of hydrocortisone (HC) can lead to a reduction in skinfold thickness, epidermal thickness, and the number of proliferating cell nucleus antigen (PCNA)-positive keratinocytes, which are all indicators of skin atrophy. Therefore, it supports the statement that hydrocortisone treats skin atrophy, as it can help manage the symptoms, but it's important to note that it can also cause it with long-term use."
15127550,Hydrocortisone treats synovitis,47,"RESULTS: Following induction of synovitis, ground reaction forces were significantly decreased relative to preinduction values at 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 hours and serum cortisol concentration was significantly increased at 2.5 hours.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats synovitis' supported by the sentence: 'RESULTS: Following induction of synovitis, ground reaction forces were significantly decreased relative to preinduction values at 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 hours and serum cortisol concentration was significantly increased at 2.5 hours.'?","Yes, it is indirectly supported. The increased serum cortisol concentration at 2.5 hours suggests that hydrocortisone (a type of corticosteroid) has been administered, which is a treatment for synovitis. The decrease in ground reaction forces indicates a reduction in inflammation, which is a result of successful treatment. However, the sentence does not explicitly state that hydrocortisone is used to treat synovitis in this context."
10942128,Hydrocortisone treats epilepsy,48,Hydrocortisone-induced convulsions.,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats epilepsy' supported by the sentence: 'Hydrocortisone-induced convulsions.'?,"No, this statement does not support the claim that Hydrocortisone treats epilepsy, but rather suggests a potential side effect of Hydrocortisone, which is hydrocortisone-induced convulsions."
10815606,Hydrocortisone treats acute adrenal insufficiency,49,We describe a case of aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma (APA) associated with a probable post-operative adrenal crisis possibly due to subtle autonomous cortisol secretion.,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats acute adrenal insufficiency' supported by the sentence: 'We describe a case of aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma (APA) associated with a probable post-operative adrenal crisis possibly due to subtle autonomous cortisol secretion.'?,"No, it is not directly or indirectly supported by that sentence.
