It suggests that mebendazole, an oral medication used for treating certain parasitic worm infections, has been associated with causing liver injury with inflammatory responses, not that it treats injuries."
13885379,mebendazole treats Inactivation,44,Mebendazole induces apoptosis via Bcl-2 inactivation in chemoresistant melanoma cells.,True,Is the triple 'mebendazole treats Inactivation' supported by the sentence: 'Mebendazole induces apoptosis via Bcl-2 inactivation in chemoresistant melanoma cells.'?,"Yes, the statement you provided suggests that mebendazole can inactivate Bcl-2, which is a protein that inhibits apoptosis, or programmed cell death. Therefore, by inactivating Bcl-2, mebendazole could potentially induce apoptosis, as concluded in the study you mentioned. However, the statement does not directly mention that mebendazole treats inactivation, but rather it suggests a potential mechanism by which mebendazole could be used to treat certain conditions, such as chemoresistant melanoma, by promoting cell death."
12876761,mebendazole treats infertility disorder,45,"The evaluation also highlighted that there were critical issues for the successful implementation of the program such as the issue of educating illiterate mothers, higher involvement of families in the mass treatment process, ability to reach a larger number of school absentees, and overcoming the prejudice against externally funded measures, which are perceived by some of the members of the community as an experiment run by foreigners on the local population and the concern of some parents that anthelmintic drug (mebendazole) might cause sexual sterility.",False,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats infertility disorder' supported by the sentence: 'The evaluation also highlighted that there were critical issues for the successful implementation of the program such as the issue of educating illiterate mothers, higher involvement of families in the mass treatment process, ability to reach a larger number of school absentees, and overcoming the prejudice against externally funded measures, which are perceived by some of the members of the community as an experiment run by foreigners on the local population and the concern of some parents that anthelmintic drug (mebendazole) might cause sexual sterility.'?","No, this conclusion is not directly supported by the provided information. The text discusses challenges in implementing a mass treatment program using mebendazole, but it does not make a claim about mebendazole treating infertility disorders."
11280026,mebendazole treats Increased reactive oxygen species production,46,"A comparative study of albendazole and mebendazole-induced, time-dependent oxidative stress.",False,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats Increased reactive oxygen species production' supported by the sentence: 'A comparative study of albendazole and mebendazole-induced, time-dependent oxidative stress.'?","No, the conclusion you mentioned is not directly drawn from the title you provided. The title discusses a comparison between the oxidative stress induced by albendazole and mebendazole, but it does not explicitly state that mebendazole treats increased reactive oxygen species production. For a definitive answer, you would need to read the full text of the study to understand the specific findings and conclusions drawn by the authors."
11046187,mebendazole treats poisoning,47,"Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).",False,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats poisoning' supported by the sentence: 'Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).'?","No, that conclusion is not directly supported by the provided statement. The statement discusses the cytotoxic effects of mebendazole (MBZ) on certain cells, but it does not mention anything about treating poisoning."
11046186,mebendazole treats cytotoxicity,48,"Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).",False,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats cytotoxicity' supported by the sentence: 'Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).'?","No, this statement is not explicitly stating that mebendazole treats cytotoxicity. It is stating that mebendazole can cause cytotoxicity at certain concentrations after a certain period of time."
9926628,mebendazole treats Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung,49,Oral administration of MZ in mice elicited a strong antitumor effect in a s.c. model and reduced lung colonies in experimentally induced lung metastasis without any toxicity when compared with paclitaxel-treated mice.,False,Is the triple 'mebendazole treats Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung' supported by the sentence: 'Oral administration of MZ in mice elicited a strong antitumor effect in a s.c. model and reduced lung colonies in experimentally induced lung metastasis without any toxicity when compared with paclitaxel-treated mice.'?,"No, the conclusion that mebendazole treats secondary malignant neoplasm of the lung cannot be directly drawn from this statement. The statement describes an experiment conducted on mice, not humans, and therefore cannot be directly applied to clinical situations. Furthermore, while the results suggest that mebendazole has potential as an anti-cancer agent, it does not confirm that it is an effective treatment for secondary malignant neoplasm of the lung in humans."
9926626,mebendazole treats spindle assembly,50,"MZ induces abnormal spindle formation in mitotic cancer cells and enhances the depolymerization of tubulin, but the efficacy of depolymerization by MZ is lower than that by nocodazole.",False,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats spindle assembly' supported by the sentence: 'MZ induces abnormal spindle formation in mitotic cancer cells and enhances the depolymerization of tubulin, but the efficacy of depolymerization by MZ is lower than that by nocodazole.'?","No, this conclusion is not directly supported by your statement. While it's true that mebendazole (MZ) can cause abnormal spindle formation and enhance tubulin depolymerization, your statement does not provide enough information to conclude that it specifically treats spindle assembly problems, nor does it compare its efficacy to other treatments like nocodazole."
9926624,mebendazole treats Apoptosis,51,The anthelmintic drug mebendazole induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis by depolymerizing tubulin in non-small cell lung cancer cells.,False,Is the triple 'mebendazole treats Apoptosis' supported by the sentence: 'The anthelmintic drug mebendazole induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis by depolymerizing tubulin in non-small cell lung cancer cells.'?,"No, the study you mentioned examines the effects of the anti-parasitic drug Mebendazole on non-small cell lung cancer cells, specifically its ability to induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis through tubulin depolymerization. However, it does not directly conclude that Mebendazole specifically treats Apoptosis, which is a process of programmed cell death, not a disease itself."
