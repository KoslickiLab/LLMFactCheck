The sentence mentions a 6-year-old boy who had acquired relapsing TTP, which was previously managed with plasmapheresis and prednisolone, indicating that prednisolone was used as part of the treatment regimen for this patient's TTP relapses. Therefore, it can be inferred that prednisolone has some therapeutic effect on TTP, even if it is not the primary treatment or works in conjunction with other treatments like plasmapheresis in this case. However, it is important to note that this is an inference based on one example, and further research would be needed to establish more definitive conclusions about prednisolone's effectiveness in treating TTP."
14012190,Prednisolone treats angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma,1115,"Three months later, AILD relapsed in spite of prednisolone treatment.",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma' supported by the sentence: 'Three months later, AILD relapsed in spite of prednisolone treatment.'?","No, this sentence does not provide indirect support for the statement that Prednisolone treats angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AILD). In fact, it suggests the opposite - that prednisolone was not effective in treating AILD in this particular case, as the disease relapsed despite treatment. However, this does not rule out the possibility that prednisolone may be effective in other cases of AILD. It is also important to note that medical treatments often have complex mechanisms of action and responses, and a single case does not necessarily reflect the overall efficacy of a treatment."

The sentence mentions a case where high-dose Prednisolone was used to treat acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis in a patient with optic neuritis caused by disseminated encephalomyelitis. This suggests that Prednisolone was used as a treatment for the patient's optic neuritis, even though it was not its primary purpose in this instance."
13566191,Prednisolone treats follicular lymphoma,1117,"The addition of rituximab to cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (CVP) for advanced follicular lymphoma increases median time to progression by 17 months.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats follicular lymphoma' supported by the sentence: 'The addition of rituximab to cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisolone (CVP) for advanced follicular lymphoma increases median time to progression by 17 months.'?","Yes, this sentence does provide indirect support for the statement that Prednisolone treats follicular lymphoma when used in combination therapy. The sentence states that adding Rituximab to Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, and Prednisolone (CVP) increases the median time to progression for advanced follicular lymphoma by 17 months, which suggests that Prednisolone, as part of this combination therapy, is contributing to treating this type of cancer, even if it doesn't explicitly state Prednisolone alone has this effect. However, this is an indirect inference, as it does not directly state Prednisolone has this effect on its own, but rather as part of this combination therapy."
13327146,Prednisolone treats allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,1118,"Here 2 cases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in a family (brother and sister), treated with prednisolone with complete remission are reported.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis' supported by the sentence: 'Here 2 cases of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in a family (brother and sister), treated with prednisolone with complete remission are reported.'?","Yes, this statement does provide indirect support for the claim that Prednisolone treats allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. The sentence reports two cases of this condition, both of which were treated with Prednisolone and resulted in complete remission. This suggests that Prednisolone could be an effective treatment for this condition, although it does not prove it directly as other factors could have contributed to the remission."

11988157,Prednisolone treats diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,1122,"CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) has been the standard chemotherapy regimen used for diffuse large cell lymphomas for over 30 years.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats diffuse large B-cell lymphoma' supported by the sentence: 'CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) has been the standard chemotherapy regimen used for diffuse large cell lymphomas for over 30 years.'?","Yes, this statement does provide indirect support for the claim that Prednisolone can be used to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The sentence states that CHOP, which includes Prednisolone, has been a standard chemotherapy regimen for this type of lymphoma for over 30 years. Therefore, it can be inferred that Prednisolone, as part of this regimen, has been used in the treatment of this disease. However, it is important to note that this does not directly prove that Prednisolone alone is effective in treating this type of lymphoma, as it is always used in combination with other drugs in the CHOP regimen."
11889996,Prednisolone treats mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome,1123,"Six patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) were treated with prednisolone (1 to 2 mg/kg/day) for 3 days (from days 10 to 12 after the onset of the illness) after apparently unsuccessful treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2 g/kg/dose and additional 1 g/kg/dose).",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome' supported by the sentence: 'Six patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) were treated with prednisolone (1 to 2 mg/kg/day) for 3 days (from days 10 to 12 after the onset of the illness) after apparently unsuccessful treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG, 2 g/kg/dose and additional 1 g/kg/dose).'?","Yes, this sentence does provide indirect support for the statement that Prednisolone can be used to treat mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, which is another name for Kawasaki disease (KD). The sentence mentions six patients with KD who were treated with Prednisolone after initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was unsuccessful. This suggests that Prednisolone is considered as a viable treatment option for KD, which aligns with the statement that Prednisolone can be used to treat mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome (KD). However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference, as the sentence does not explicitly state that Prednisolone is used to treat KD, but rather it infers this from the context provided."
11813573,Prednisolone treats focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,1124,"RESULTS: Of 136 patients with primary FSGS and nephrotic range proteinuria, 76 (56%) were treated with prednisolone and of this group, 59% were treated with additional immunosuppression.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats focal segmental glomerulosclerosis' supported by the sentence: 'RESULTS: Of 136 patients with primary FSGS and nephrotic range proteinuria, 76 (56%) were treated with prednisolone and of this group, 59% were treated with additional immunosuppression.'?","Yes, this sentence does indirectly support the statement that Prednisolone treats focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The sentence mentions that 56% of patients with primary FSGS were treated with prednisolone, which implies that prednisolone is used as a treatment for FSGS. However, it does not directly support the effectiveness of prednisolone in treating FSGS, as it does not provide information about the outcomes of the treatment. The additional immunosuppression mentioned could also be a part of the treatment, making it indirect support at best."
11810617,Prednisolone treats congenital adrenal hyperplasia,1125,"METHODS: Growth parameters of twelve children (8 m, 4 f) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia were retrospectively studied while on treatment with prednisolone (PR) earlier and then hydrocortisone (HC) after it became freely available in India.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats congenital adrenal hyperplasia' supported by the sentence: 'METHODS: Growth parameters of twelve children (8 m, 4 f) with congenital adrenal hyperplasia were retrospectively studied while on treatment with prednisolone (PR) earlier and then hydrocortisone (HC) after it became freely available in India.'?","Yes, there is indirect support for this statement based on the provided sentence. The sentence mentions a retrospective study on growth parameters in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia who were treated with Prednisolone (PR) earlier, then hydrocortisone (HC) after it became available in India. Prednisolone is known to be used in the treatment of various conditions, including congenital adrenal hyperplasia, as it helps to manage symptoms such as abnormal growth patterns in patients by suppressing hormonal imbalances caused by this condition. However, it is important to note that this statement is indirectly supported, as it does not directly mention Prednisolone treating congenital adrenal hyperplasia, but rather implies it through its mention in relation to this condition in this study."
11808057,Prednisolone treats keratitis,1126,Ciprofloxacin and prednisolone therapy for experimental Pseudomonas keratitis.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats keratitis' supported by the sentence: 'Ciprofloxacin and prednisolone therapy for experimental Pseudomonas keratitis.'?,"Yes, the sentence does indirectly support the statement that Prednisolone treats keratitis. The sentence ""Ciprofloxacin and prednisolone therapy for experimental Pseudomonas keratitis"" implies that both Ciprofloxacin and Prednisolone are used in the treatment of Pseudomonas keratitis, which is a type of keratitis.

Prednicarbate is a derivative of prednisolone, and it is used for treating inflammatory skin diseases, including atopic dermatitis. This suggests that prednisolone itself could also be used for treating these conditions, as it is the base molecule for prednicarbate. However, this is an indirect inference and further direct evidence would be needed to confirm this."

The sentence mentions that Prednisolone was used in the treatment of a case of hemolytic anemia, which suggests it was considered as a therapeutic option for this condition. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference, as the sentence does not explicitly state that Prednisolone is effective in treating hemolytic anemia. Additionally, other treatments (ACTH, cortisone) were also used, which could indicate a complex clinical situation where multiple interventions were necessary, rather than Prednisolone being solely responsible for treating the condition."

9538921,Prednisolone treats Graves disease,1150,"She was diagnosed as having Graves' disease and was treated with propylthiouracil, and prednisolone was given for neck pain.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats Graves disease' supported by the sentence: 'She was diagnosed as having Graves' disease and was treated with propylthiouracil, and prednisolone was given for neck pain.'?","Yes, the statement ""She was diagnosed as having Graves' disease and was treated with propylthiouracil, and prednisolone was given for neck pain."" does indirectly support the claim ""Prednisolone treats Graves disease"". This is because prednisolone was administered to the patient who was diagnosed with Graves' disease, although it was given for neck pain, not for treating the disease itself. This suggests that prednisolone could potentially have some effect on Graves' disease, even if it was not its primary purpose in this context. However, it is important to note that this does not directly demonstrate that prednisolone is an effective treatment for Graves' disease, as it could have been given for another reason entirely, such as managing symptoms associated with the disease but not directly caused by it, or for an entirely separate condition."

7927983,Prednisolone treats nephrotic syndrome,1174,"The second patient, a 73-year-old man receiving prednisolone therapy for nephrotic syndrome, developed right leg cellulitis that evolved to NF.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats nephrotic syndrome' supported by the sentence: 'The second patient, a 73-year-old man receiving prednisolone therapy for nephrotic syndrome, developed right leg cellulitis that evolved to NF.'?","Yes, this statement does provide indirect support for the claim that prednisolone can be used to treat nephrotic syndrome. The patient in question was already receiving prednisolone therapy for nephrotic syndrome, which suggests that prednisolone is being used as part of the treatment regimen for this condition. The development of cellulitis in this patient does not negate this fact, but rather adds an additional complication to their health status. However, it is important to note that this does not directly prove that prednisolone is effective in treating nephrotic syndrome, as it could be one part of a larger treatment plan, or it could be ineffective for this particular patient but still part of standard treatment protocols."
7900660,Prednisolone treats temporal arteritis,1175,"At the time of diagnosis, patients with GCA had an increased median serum level of YKL-40 (256 microg/liter; P<0.01) compared with healthy age-matched controls (median 118 microg/liter), and the serum level of YKL-40 decreased to normal levels during prednisolone treatment (-38% after 1 month; P<0.001).",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats temporal arteritis' supported by the sentence: 'At the time of diagnosis, patients with GCA had an increased median serum level of YKL-40 (256 microg/liter; P<0.01) compared with healthy age-matched controls (median 118 microg/liter), and the serum level of YKL-40 decreased to normal levels during prednisolone treatment (-38% after 1 month; P<0.001).'?","Yes, the statement is indirectly supported by this sentence. This is because it mentions that serum levels of YKL-40 decreased during prednisolone treatment in patients with GCA (giant cell arteritis), which is an inflammatory condition also known as temporal arteritis. This suggests that prednisolone could be an effective treatment for reducing inflammation in this condition, as indicated by the decrease in YKL-40 levels, which is associated with inflammation. However, it does not explicitly state that prednisolone is used to treat temporal arteritis, but it does provide evidence for its potential use in treating inflammatory conditions like it, thus being indirectly supported."
7900659,Prednisolone treats polymyalgia rheumatica,1176,Most patients with PMR had normal serum YKL-40 levels (median 158 microg/liter) and had no changes in the serum YKL-40 levels during prednisolone treatment.,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats polymyalgia rheumatica' supported by the sentence: 'Most patients with PMR had normal serum YKL-40 levels (median 158 microg/liter) and had no changes in the serum YKL-40 levels during prednisolone treatment.'?,"No, this sentence does not support the statement that Prednisolone treats polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). In fact, it suggests the opposite. The sentence indicates that most patients with PMR had normal serum YKL-40 levels both before and after prednisolone treatment, implying that the prednisolone may not be directly influencing the condition. However, it is important to note that this is based on one specific marker, YKL-40, and other factors could still be at play."

7819165,Prednisolone treats systemic lupus erythematosus,1178,Subacute severe steatohepatitis during prednisolone therapy for systemic lupus erythematosis.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats systemic lupus erythematosus' supported by the sentence: 'Subacute severe steatohepatitis during prednisolone therapy for systemic lupus erythematosis.'?,"Yes, it is indirectly supported by the sentence provided. The sentence states that subacute severe steatohepatitis occurred during prednisolone therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Prednisolone is a type of corticosteroid, which is often used to treat SLE due to its anti-inflammatory effects. However, long-term use of corticosteroids like prednisolone can lead to side effects such as steatohepatitis, which is inflammation of the liver due to fat accumulation. Therefore, while prednisolone is used to treat SLE, its use can also lead to complications like steatohepatitis, as suggested in this sentence."
7800931,Prednisolone treats autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura,1179,"However, after administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG) (0.4 g/kg/day x 5 days), low-dose PSL (20 mg/day) alleviated the LEMS and ITP, and the diseases have remained in remission for 8 months without additional IVIG.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura' supported by the sentence: 'However, after administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG) (0.4 g/kg/day x 5 days), low-dose PSL (20 mg/day) alleviated the LEMS and ITP, and the diseases have remained in remission for 8 months without additional IVIG.'?","Yes, this sentence does indirectly support the statement that Prednisolone (PSL) treats autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The sentence mentions that after administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG), low-dose PSL (which is Prednisolone) was used to alleviate ITP, and the disease has remained in remission for 8 months without additional IVIG. This suggests that Prednisolone was effective in treating ITP, at least in this specific case. However, it's important to note that this is based on one case study, so further research would be needed to confirm this finding."
7704078,Prednisolone treats colitis,1180,"On the other hand, prednisolone and short chain fatty acids seemed to improve only the physiologic changes of colitis.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats colitis' supported by the sentence: 'On the other hand, prednisolone and short chain fatty acids seemed to improve only the physiologic changes of colitis.'?","Yes, the sentence does provide indirect support for the statement ""Prednisolone treats colitis"". The sentence mentions that prednisolone seemed to improve only the physiologic changes of colitis, which implies that prednisolone has some positive effect on colitis, thus providing support for the statement that prednisolone treats colitis, albeit indirectly. Short chain fatty acids also seemed to improve only the physiologic changes of colitis, but since they were mentioned alongside prednisolone, it is assumed they were being compared, further emphasizing prednisolone's effect on colitis."
7676165,Prednisolone treats hypercalcemia disease,1181,"Treatment with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, transurethral lithotomy, saline infusion, and prednisolone (30 mg/day) alleviated the urolithiasis, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats hypercalcemia disease' supported by the sentence: 'Treatment with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, transurethral lithotomy, saline infusion, and prednisolone (30 mg/day) alleviated the urolithiasis, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia.'?","Yes, the statement is indirectly supported because prednisolone is used in treating hypercalcemia which is one component in the mentioned sentence, along with other treatments, to alleviate urolithiasis, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia. However, it does not explicitly state prednisolone is used to treat hypercalcemia in this particular case, but it is still associated with its treatment in this context."

The mention of a 25-year-old man being treated with high-dose Prednisolone for UC suggests that Prednisolone is used as a treatment for UC. However, it does not directly imply that Prednisolone is effective in treating UC, but it does provide evidence for its use in treatment."
7485161,Prednisolone treats uveitis,1185,DISCUSSION: Allopurinol is more effective than prednisolone in treating EAU.,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats uveitis' supported by the sentence: 'DISCUSSION: Allopurinol is more effective than prednisolone in treating EAU.'?,"No, this statement does not support the triple statement ""Prednisolone treats uveitis"". In fact, it suggests Allopurinol is more effective than Prednisolone in treating EAU (Experimental Autoimmune Uveoretinitis), which implies Prednisolone may not be as effective in treating EAU as Allopurinol, not necessarily that Prednisolone is not effective in treating uveitis in general."

In this sentence, it is mentioned that Interleukin-5 (IL-5) mRNA was detected in all asthmatic patients before prednisolone therapy, implying an association between IL-5 levels and asthma symptoms. After prednisolone therapy, IL-5 mRNA was only detected in non-GCS-responsive BHR (Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness) asthmatic patients, which could suggest that prednisolone is effective in reducing IL-5 levels in certain subtypes of asthmatic patients, potentially alleviating their symptoms. However, this does not directly prove that prednisolone is effective in treating asthma in general, as it may not work for all subtypes, including GCS-responsive BHR asthmatic patients, as mentioned in the statement."
7417999,Prednisolone treats IgA glomerulonephritis,1187,"Combined therapy with prednisolone, azathioprine, heparin-warfarin, and dipyridamole for paediatric patients with severe IgA nephropathy--is it relevant for adult patients?",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone treats IgA glomerulonephritis' supported by the sentence: 'Combined therapy with prednisolone, azathioprine, heparin-warfarin, and dipyridamole for paediatric patients with severe IgA nephropathy--is it relevant for adult patients?'?","No, this statement does not provide direct or indirect support for the claim that Prednisolone treats IgA glomerulonephritis. The sentence discusses combined therapy for severe IgA nephropathy in paediatric patients, but it does not specify which component of the therapy is responsible for treating IgA nephropathy, nor does it mention IgA glomerulonephritis specifically."

The sentence provided discusses the potential of certain cyanine dyes as selective scaffolds to treat C. albicans infections, but it does not mention hydrocortisone or infections caused by anything other than C. albicans. Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid hormone used primarily for its anti-inflammatory effects, not for treating infections, especially those caused by C. albicans. Therefore, there is no implicit support for the initial claim in this statement."
21368080,Hydrocortisone treats lymphoma,1192,The serum cortisol concentration in the LYMPH patients was 285 +/- 74 nmol/l.,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats lymphoma' supported by the sentence: 'The serum cortisol concentration in the LYMPH patients was 285 +/- 74 nmol/l.'?,"No, this statement does not provide direct support for the claim that hydrocortisone treats lymphoma. The serum cortisol concentration in lymph patients being 285 +/- 74 nmol/l only provides information about cortisol levels in lymph patients, not about the effectiveness of hydrocortisone in treating lymphoma. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, a hormone that the body produces naturally in response to stress, so this statement doesn't imply any correlation between hydrocortisone and treatment of lymphoma."
19834754,Hydrocortisone treats cardiac arrest,1193,"Compared to controls, glycocalyx was mildly injured by CA, severely disrupted by hyaluronidase (HAase) with CA, and mitigated by hydrocortisone (HC) with CA.",False,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats cardiac arrest' supported by the sentence: 'Compared to controls, glycocalyx was mildly injured by CA, severely disrupted by hyaluronidase (HAase) with CA, and mitigated by hydrocortisone (HC) with CA.'?","No, this statement does not provide direct support for the claim that hydrocortisone treats cardiac arrest (CA).

16946872,Hydrocortisone treats adrenal cortex neoplasm,1195,"The mean (+/- SD) plasma cortisol concentration for the initial 8-hour testing period was highest in 18 dogs with adrenocortical tumor (5.3 +/- 1.6 micrograms/dl), lowest in 15 control dogs (1.3 +/- 0.5 micrograms/dl), and intermediate in 31 dogs with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH; 3.4 +/- 1.2 micrograms/dl).",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats adrenal cortex neoplasm' supported by the sentence: 'The mean (+/- SD) plasma cortisol concentration for the initial 8-hour testing period was highest in 18 dogs with adrenocortical tumor (5.3 +/- 1.6 micrograms/dl), lowest in 15 control dogs (1.3 +/- 0.5 micrograms/dl), and intermediate in 31 dogs with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH; 3.4 +/- 1.2 micrograms/dl).'?","Yes, this statement does provide indirect support for the idea that hydrocortisone, which is a type of steroid hormone produced in the adrenal cortex, could potentially be used to treat adrenal cortex neoplasm (a type of tumor). The sentence provides data showing that dogs with an adrenocortical tumor have significantly higher plasma cortisol concentrations compared to control dogs, indicating an overproduction of cortisol in these dogs due to the tumor in their adrenal gland. 

         Hydrocortisone, as well as other glucocorticoids, can be used to suppress endogenous corticosteroid production in dogs, helping to manage hyperadrenocorticism, which is often associated with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) but can also be caused by tumors in the adrenal gland itself (adrenocortical tumor). Therefore, hydrocortisone might be used as a treatment for lowering excessive steroid hormones in cases where an adrenal gland tumor is present, although this would depend on various factors such as tumor type, size, location,"
15753359,Hydrocortisone treats dissociative amnesia,1196,Our results suggest that PL may increase the availability of cortisol in chronically stressed men and may attenuate stress-induced memory impairments.,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone treats dissociative amnesia' supported by the sentence: 'Our results suggest that PL may increase the availability of cortisol in chronically stressed men and may attenuate stress-induced memory impairments.'?,"No, this statement is not indirectly supported by this sentence. The sentence suggests that prefrontal cortex stimulation (PL) may increase cortisol availability in chronically stressed men, which may attenuate stress-induced memory impairments. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, but there is no mention of it being used in this study, nor is there any direct or indirect reference to it treating dissociative amnesia in this sentence."

The sentence mentions that cortisol is commonly used to treat psoriasis, and hydrocortisone is a form of cortisol. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference, as the original sentence does not specifically mention hydrocortisone. The dysregulation of epidermal steroid synthesis suggested in the sentence could potentially be corrected by various forms of cortisol, including hydrocortisone, but this is not explicitly stated in the sentence."

7827490,Methylprednisolone treats optic neuritis,1300,CONCLUSIONS: The ONTT has led to a dramatic reduction in the use of oral prednisone without a preceding course of intravenous methylprednisolone in the treatment of acute optic neuritis.,True,Is the triple 'Methylprednisolone treats optic neuritis' supported by the sentence: 'CONCLUSIONS: The ONTT has led to a dramatic reduction in the use of oral prednisone without a preceding course of intravenous methylprednisolone in the treatment of acute optic neuritis.'?,"Yes, this statement does provide indirect support for the claim that Methylprednisolone is used to treat optic neuritis, as it mentions intravenous methylprednisolone as part of the treatment regimen for acute optic neuritis in the ONTT (Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial). However, it does not explicitly state that Methylprednisolone is used to treat optic neuritis, but rather implies it through its reference in the treatment protocol for acute optic neuritis in the ONTT study, which led to reduced use of oral prednisone when not preceded by intravenous methylprednisolone in such treatments."
7808987,Methylprednisolone treats autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura,1301,CONCLUSION: A short intravenous course of high-dose methylprednisolone is effective as initial treatment of adults with ITP.,True,Is the triple 'Methylprednisolone treats autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura' supported by the sentence: 'CONCLUSION: A short intravenous course of high-dose methylprednisolone is effective as initial treatment of adults with ITP.'?,"Yes, this is indirectly supported. The sentence states that high-dose methylprednisolone is effective as initial treatment for adults with ITP (Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura), which is an autoimmune disease where the body attacks its own platelets leading to low platelet counts, also known as thrombocytopenia. Therefore, methylprednisolone, being effective in treating ITP, can indirectly be said to treat autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura, as it is essentially treating one form (ITP) of this condition. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect inference, as ITP is not explicitly stated as being equivalent to autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura in this conclusion, although they share similar characteristics as mentioned above."
7700869,Methylprednisolone treats Edema,1302,"Lipid peroxidation and oedema in experimental brain injury: comparison of treatment with methylprednisolone, tirilazad mesylate and vitamin E.",False,"Is the triple 'Methylprednisolone treats Edema' supported by the sentence: 'Lipid peroxidation and oedema in experimental brain injury: comparison of treatment with methylprednisolone, tirilazad mesylate and vitamin E.'?","No, this statement is not indirectly supported by the given sentence. The sentence discusses an experimental brain injury study where methylprednisolone, tirilazad mesylate, and vitamin E were compared in terms of their effects on lipid peroxidation and oedema (edema).

However, it does not directly mention Methylprednisolone as a treatment for inflammation, but it does support its anti-inflammatory properties, which is one way it can treat inflammation."
7483648,Methylprednisolone treats adult acute respiratory distress syndrome,1306,Severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome with shock and ARDS resulting from Still's disease: clinical response with high-dose pulse methylprednisolone therapy.,True,Is the triple 'Methylprednisolone treats adult acute respiratory distress syndrome' supported by the sentence: 'Severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome with shock and ARDS resulting from Still's disease: clinical response with high-dose pulse methylprednisolone therapy.'?,"Yes, this statement does provide indirect evidence supporting the use of Methylprednisolone to treat adult Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). The sentence mentions successful treatment of ARDS in an adult patient who had it as a complication of Still's disease using high-dose pulse methylprednisolone therapy. Therefore, it suggests methylprednisolone as an effective treatment for ARDS, although it was used in conjunction with treating Still's disease, which is an autoimmune disorder characterized by systemic inflammation, fever, rash, and joint pain, among other symptoms. However, it is important to note that direct clinical trials may be required to establish more conclusive evidence for this treatment in ARDS patients without Still's disease, as various factors could influence treatment response, including underlying conditions, disease severity, dosage, treatment duration, and patient-specific genetic factors, among others."

The sentence mentions that eosinophilic fasciitis associated with autoimmune thyroid disease and myelodysplasia was treated with pulsed methylprednisolone and antihistamines, implying that methylprednisolone was used to treat the MDS component in this case, even though it was not specifically mentioned as the sole treatment for MDS. However, it is important to note that this is only one case report, so further research is needed to establish this as a definitive treatment for MDS."
16097513,Cefotaxime treats osteomyelitis,1308,Cefotaxime in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis caused by gram-negative bacilli.,True,Is the triple 'Cefotaxime treats osteomyelitis' supported by the sentence: 'Cefotaxime in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis caused by gram-negative bacilli.'?,"Yes, this statement is indirectly supported by the provided sentence. The sentence states that Cefotaxime can be used in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis caused by gram-negative bacilli. This implies that Cefotaxime can be effective against certain types of bacterial infections in bone tissue, which is what osteomyelitis is. Therefore, it can be inferred that Cefotaxime could potentially be used to treat osteomyelitis, even though the original sentence does not explicitly state this."
15119078,Cefotaxime treats peritonitis,1309,Aztreonam and cefotaxime were compared in 44 cirrhotic patients who had 52 episodes of gram-negative spontaneous peritonitis.,True,Is the triple 'Cefotaxime treats peritonitis' supported by the sentence: 'Aztreonam and cefotaxime were compared in 44 cirrhotic patients who had 52 episodes of gram-negative spontaneous peritonitis.'?,"Yes, this statement does indirectly support the claim that Cefotaxime can be used to treat Peritonitis in some cases, as it mentions Cefotaxime being used in patients who had episodes of spontaneous Peritonitis, which is a type of Peritonitis. However, it does not specifically state that Cefotaxime was used to treat Peritonitis in these cases, nor does it compare its effectiveness to other treatments for Peritonitis, such as Aztreonam alone."

Rocephin, as mentioned in the study, has been clinically tested for various septicaemias, which is another term for sepsis. This implies that antibiotics within the same class as Rocephin, like Ceftriaxone, could also be effective in treating sepsis due to their similar mechanisms of action. However, it is important to note that this does not directly prove Ceftriaxone's efficacy in treating sepsis, as it would require clinical studies specifically involving Ceftriaxone to confirm its effectiveness in treating sepsis patients."
18413392,Ceftriaxone treats bacterial pneumonia,1314,"The objectives of this open, prospective, randomized and comparative study were to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous ceftriaxone (active ingredient of Rocephin) and cefotaxime in treatment of bacterial pneumoniae.",True,"Is the triple 'Ceftriaxone treats bacterial pneumonia' supported by the sentence: 'The objectives of this open, prospective, randomized and comparative study were to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous ceftriaxone (active ingredient of Rocephin) and cefotaxime in treatment of bacterial pneumoniae.'?","Yes, the statement ""Ceftriaxone treats bacterial pneumonia"" is at least indirectly supported by the sentence provided. This is because Ceftriaxone is mentioned as an active ingredient in Rocephin, which is being studied for its efficacy and safety in treating bacterial pneumonia in comparison to cefotaxime. However, it is important to note that this does not directly confirm that Ceftriaxone alone treats bacterial pneumonia, as it is being compared to another treatment in this study."

The title ""Clinicobiological evolution of duodenal ulcer treated with gefarnate"" suggests that this study is investigating the effects of gefarnate on duodenal ulcers, implying that gefarnate is used to treat this condition. However, it doesn't provide direct evidence of gefarnate treating duodenal ulcers as it might be studying other aspects like side effects, efficacy rates, etc., hence it is indirectly supported."
19702373,Gefarnate treats peptic ulcer disease,1317,"One hundred and thirty-nine patients with endoscopically confirmed peptic ulcers (gastric and duodenal) entered a double blind comparative evaluation of alprazolam (1.2 mg/day), gefarnate (300 mg/day) and their combination in treatment of peptic ulcer.",True,"Is the triple 'Gefarnate treats peptic ulcer disease' supported by the sentence: 'One hundred and thirty-nine patients with endoscopically confirmed peptic ulcers (gastric and duodenal) entered a double blind comparative evaluation of alprazolam (1.2 mg/day), gefarnate (300 mg/day) and their combination in treatment of peptic ulcer.'?","Yes, this statement does indirectly support the claim that gefarnate treats peptic ulcer disease. The sentence mentions a double-blind comparative evaluation where patients with endoscopically confirmed peptic ulcers (gastric and duodenal) were given gefarnate (300 mg/day) as part of the study, which suggests that gefarnate was being investigated for its potential in treating peptic ulcers. However, it is important to note that this does not confirm gefarnate as an effective treatment, as further analysis and results from this study would be required to make such a conclusion."
22023951,Regadenoson treats coronary artery disorder,1318,CONCLUSIONS: Regadenoson may be a safe vasodilator for CTP and MR MPI in CAD patients.,True,Is the triple 'Regadenoson treats coronary artery disorder' supported by the sentence: 'CONCLUSIONS: Regadenoson may be a safe vasodilator for CTP and MR MPI in CAD patients.'?,"Yes, this statement can be interpreted as indirect support for the claim. The conclusion mentions Regadenoson as a safe vasodilator for Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (MR) Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MPI) in Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) patients, which implies it could be used to treat CAD, although it doesn't explicitly state it directly treats the disorder but rather helps in diagnosing it."

The sentence indicates that a study was conducted on 38 patients with ischemic stroke, and the drug used in this study was mildronate (which is chemically similar to Meldonium). However, it's important to note that this does not directly prove that Meldonium is an effective treatment for ischemic stroke, as we don't know the specific outcomes of this study, its methodology, or whether it has been peer-reviewed or replicated. Therefore, while there is some suggestive evidence, further research would be needed to definitively support this claim."
25624167,Neobiotic treats pneumonia,1320,Use of neomycin for treatment of Rhodococcus equi pneumonia in foals.,True,Is the triple 'Neobiotic treats pneumonia' supported by the sentence: 'Use of neomycin for treatment of Rhodococcus equi pneumonia in foals.'?,"Yes, this statement does provide indirect support for the claim that neobiotic (a term often used interchangeably with antibiotics, which neomycin is) can treat pneumonia. The sentence explicitly states that neomycin is used for treating Rhodococcus equi pneumonia in foals, which directly supports the idea that neomycin can be used to treat pneumonia, albeit in a specific context (foals with Rhodococcus equi pneumonia). However, it does not directly support the claim that neobiotics generally treat all types of pneumonia, hence the term 'indirectly'."
11022701,Neobiotic treats bacterial infectious disease with sepsis,1321,Osteomyelitis of the cervical vertebras as a complication of urinary tract disease; Proteus bacteremia treated with neomycin.,True,Is the triple 'Neobiotic treats bacterial infectious disease with sepsis' supported by the sentence: 'Osteomyelitis of the cervical vertebras as a complication of urinary tract disease; Proteus bacteremia treated with neomycin.'?,"Yes, there is indirect support for this statement based on the provided sentence. The sentence mentions the use of neomycin to treat Proteus bacteremia, which is a type of blood infection caused by bacteria from the Proteus genus, which falls under Proteobacteria - one class within Bacteria domain (as in Neobiotic treats bacterial infectious diseases). Additionally, osteomyelitis is an infection in bones, which can be considered as severe complication, similar to sepsis, which is systemic inflammatory response to an infection. However, it is important to note that osteomyelitis is not directly mentioned as being treated in this sentence, but it is mentioned as a complication caused by urinary tract infection, which was treated by neomycin, hence, there is an indirect connection to the statement in question."

26823243,Urea treats citrullinemia,1449,"The precursors of urea (ammonia, glutamate, glutamine and alpha-amino nitrogen) did not increase after the benzoate administration in the 6 normal subjects as well as in the 2 patients with citrullinaemia.",False,"Is the triple 'Urea treats citrullinemia' supported by the sentence: 'The precursors of urea (ammonia, glutamate, glutamine and alpha-amino nitrogen) did not increase after the benzoate administration in the 6 normal subjects as well as in the 2 patients with citrullinaemia.'?","No, this sentence does not indirectly support the statement that urea treats citrullinemia. The sentence mentions that benzoate administration does not increase precursors of urea in both normal subjects and patients with citrullinaemia, which does not provide evidence for urea as a treatment for citrullinemia. Citrullinemia is a disorder characterized by an accumulation of citrulline due to a deficiency in the enzyme arginosuccinate synthetase, not necessarily due to issues with urea production directly."
25855602,Urea treats argininosuccinic aciduria,1450,The relationship between the formation of urea and argininosuccinate in a patient with argininosuccinic aciduria studied with labelled precursors.,True,Is the triple 'Urea treats argininosuccinic aciduria' supported by the sentence: 'The relationship between the formation of urea and argininosuccinate in a patient with argininosuccinic aciduria studied with labelled precursors.'?,"Yes, this sentence does indirectly support the statement that urea can treat argininosuccinic aciduria (ASA). The sentence mentions the study of a patient with ASA using labelled precursors, which likely refers to substances used to synthesize other compounds in metabolic pathways, such as urea cycle intermediates. The fact that such a study was conducted suggests an interest in understanding how urea metabolism is affected in ASA patients, possibly indicating an attempt to explore urea as a potential treatment for ASA, as it can help remove excess ammonia from the body, which is one of the main issues in ASA patients. However, it is important to note that this sentence does not explicitly confirm urea as a treatment for ASA, so further research is needed to establish its efficacy in treating this disorder."
19420190,Urea treats psoriasis,1451,"In the treatment of psoriasis with urea and urea-combined preparations, the individual sequence should be so clearly prescribed such that acceptance is assured.",True,"Is the triple 'Urea treats psoriasis' supported by the sentence: 'In the treatment of psoriasis with urea and urea-combined preparations, the individual sequence should be so clearly prescribed such that acceptance is assured.'?","Yes, this statement can be seen as supporting the claim that urea treats psoriasis, albeit indirectly. The sentence suggests that urea, when used in the treatment of psoriasis, should be prescribed in a particular sequence to ensure acceptance, implying that urea is an effective treatment when used correctly. However, it does not directly state that urea is the sole cause of improved symptoms, as other factors such as the prescribed sequence could also play a role."
17323203,Urea treats radiodermatitis,1452,"RESULTS: Effective treatment with urea has been reported for the following conditions: ichthyosis, xerosis, atopic dermatitis/eczema, contact dermatitis, radiation induced dermatitis, psoriasis/seborrheic dermatitis, onychomycosis, tinea pedis, keratosis, pruritus, and dystrophic nails.",True,"Is the triple 'Urea treats radiodermatitis' supported by the sentence: 'RESULTS: Effective treatment with urea has been reported for the following conditions: ichthyosis, xerosis, atopic dermatitis/eczema, contact dermatitis, radiation induced dermatitis, psoriasis/seborrheic dermatitis, onychomycosis, tinea pedis, keratosis, pruritus, and dystrophic nails.'?","Yes, the statement is indirectly supported because radiation-induced dermatitis is one of the conditions listed in the sentence provided, and urea is reported as an effective treatment for it, which includes treating symptoms associated with radiodermatitis, thus providing indirect support for the statement ""Urea treats radiodermatitis""."

The sentence mentions that Sorafenib, which is a bis-aryl urea compound, has proven survival benefit in patients with advanced HCC. This suggests that urea-based compounds can have therapeutic effects on HCC, even though Sorafenib itself is not urea but a compound containing urea molecules. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference and further research would be needed to confirm any direct effects of urea on HCC."
12068406,Urea treats type 2 diabetes mellitus,1454,These findings are consistent with the inhibition of hepatic glycogenolysis and support the use of acyl ureas for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.,True,Is the triple 'Urea treats type 2 diabetes mellitus' supported by the sentence: 'These findings are consistent with the inhibition of hepatic glycogenolysis and support the use of acyl ureas for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.'?,"Yes, this statement can be interpreted as indirectly supporting the idea that urea can treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, as it suggests acyl ureas (a class of compounds which includes ureas) can inhibit hepatic glycogenolysis, which is a characteristic feature of type 2 diabetes management. However, it is important to note that this does not directly imply urea itself is an effective treatment, as acyl ureas may have different properties and mechanisms of action compared to urea itself. Further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis."
11649881,Urea treats Pain,1455,"Novel transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of pain: structure-activity relationships for ureas with quinoline, isoquinoline, quinazoline, phthalazine, quinoxaline, and cinnoline moieties.",True,"Is the triple 'Urea treats Pain' supported by the sentence: 'Novel transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor antagonists for the treatment of pain: structure-activity relationships for ureas with quinoline, isoquinoline, quinazoline, phthalazine, quinoxaline, and cinnoline moieties.'?","Yes, the sentence does provide indirect support for the claim that urea can treat pain, as it discusses novel transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) receptor antagonists for pain treatment, which include ureas in their structure. TRPV1 receptors play an important role in pain sensation, inflammation, and neurogenic inflammation, making them potential targets for pain management. However, it does not directly prove that urea itself is responsible for pain relief, as it could be due to other components in these ureas or their specific structural features interacting with TRPV1 receptors."
10679439,Urea treats skin disorder,1456,[TROPHIC ACTION OF UREA AND ITS USE IN THE TREATMENT OF NEUROTROPHIC SKIN DISEASES].,True,Is the triple 'Urea treats skin disorder' supported by the sentence: '[TROPHIC ACTION OF UREA AND ITS USE IN THE TREATMENT OF NEUROTROPHIC SKIN DISEASES].'?,"Yes, the statement is indirectly supported by this sentence. The phrase ""[TROPHIC ACTION OF UREA AND ITS USE IN THE TREATMENT OF NEUROTROPHIC SKIN DISEASES]"" suggests that urea has therapeutic effects on certain types of skin disorders, which could be related to neurotrophic diseases, as indicated in the title. However, it does not explicitly state that urea is used to treat general skin disorders, nor does it mention urea treating uremic pruritus specifically, which is often considered a skin disorder related to uremia, not urea itself."
10511987,Urea treats diabetes mellitus,1457,"[Preliminary note on the oral treatment of diabetes by N-sulfonyl-p-methylbenzene-N'-n-butyl urea or D 860, a product free of antibacterial action].",False,"Is the triple 'Urea treats diabetes mellitus' supported by the sentence: '[Preliminary note on the oral treatment of diabetes by N-sulfonyl-p-methylbenzene-N'-n-butyl urea or D 860, a product free of antibacterial action].'?","No, this statement does not indirectly support the claim that urea treats diabetes mellitus. The sentence mentions N-sulfonyl-p-methylbenzene-N'-n-butyl urea, also known as D 860, which is distinct from urea. Therefore, there is no connection established between urea and the treatment of diabetes mellitus in this context."

The sentence mentions a study where two creams were compared, one containing urea and sodium chloride, and the other containing urea alone, in patients with atopic dermatitis. The fact that such a study was conducted suggests that there is some basis for believing that urea could be beneficial in treating atopic dermatitis. However, it does not directly prove that urea alone is effective, as the study compared creams containing both urea and sodium chloride to those containing urea alone. Therefore, while it supports the idea that urea could be useful in treating atopic dermatitis, it does not definitively prove it."
27251301,Mannitol treats brain cancer,1459,"Hyperosmolar blood-brain barrier disruption (HBBBD), produced by infusion of mannitol into the cerebral arteries, has been used in the treatment of brain tumors to increase drug delivery to tumor and adjacent brain.",True,"Is the triple 'Mannitol treats brain cancer' supported by the sentence: 'Hyperosmolar blood-brain barrier disruption (HBBBD), produced by infusion of mannitol into the cerebral arteries, has been used in the treatment of brain tumors to increase drug delivery to tumor and adjacent brain.'?","Yes, this is supported, although indirectly, because mannitol is used to disrupt the blood-brain barrier, which allows for increased drug delivery to tumors in the brain, potentially treating brain cancer as a result."
21059003,Mannitol treats hearing loss disorder,1460,[Effects of mannitol on the fluids of the internal ear. Use in the treatment of deafness].,True,Is the triple 'Mannitol treats hearing loss disorder' supported by the sentence: '[Effects of mannitol on the fluids of the internal ear. Use in the treatment of deafness].'?,"Yes, this sentence does provide some support for the idea that Mannitol may be used in treating deafness, which is a type of hearing loss. The sentence mentions both the effects of Mannitol on the fluids of the internal ear, which is where damage to these fluids can lead to deafness, and its use in the treatment of deafness. However, it does not explicitly state that Mannitol treats hearing loss disorders, so the support is somewhat indirect."

The sentence only discusses the beneficial effect and safety of Prednisolone in pericarditis with primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) during pregnancy. Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is a distinct medical condition and this sentence does not mention nor imply any connection to it."
26194122,Prednisolone related to synovitis,210,"When combined with environmental control, prednisolone and dexamethasone treatments had similar effects on heaves score, blood gases and endoscopic scores.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone related to synovitis' supported by the sentence: 'When combined with environmental control, prednisolone and dexamethasone treatments had similar effects on heaves score, blood gases and endoscopic scores.'?","Yes, this sentence does provide indirect support for the idea that Prednisolone is related to synovitis in horses, as heaves (also known as recurrent airway obstruction) in horses is often associated with inflammation in the airways, which can be linked to synovitis in other species such as humans (though not directly stated, it is implied). The fact that Prednisolone, which is a glucocorticoid used for its anti-inflammatory properties, has similar effects on heaves score, blood gases, and endoscopic scores as Dexamethasone suggests both drugs may have comparable effects on inflammation in horses, including potential involvement in controlling inflammation in synovial tissues if present in these animals. However, further research would be required for more definitive conclusions regarding Prednisolone’s specific relationship to equine synovitis."
25959730,Prednisolone related to sarcoma,211,"Of the 20 patients, 14 initially received prednisolone treatment, which resulted in rapid improvement and normalization of eosinophilia within 8 weeks; however, 2 patients with splenomegaly showed poor control of eosinophilia in response to corticosteroid treatment.",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone related to sarcoma' supported by the sentence: 'Of the 20 patients, 14 initially received prednisolone treatment, which resulted in rapid improvement and normalization of eosinophilia within 8 weeks; however, 2 patients with splenomegaly showed poor control of eosinophilia in response to corticosteroid treatment.'?","No, this sentence does not support a direct relationship between prednisolone and sarcoma. The sentence describes the effect of prednisolone on eosinophilia in 14 out of 20 patients, but it does not mention anything about sarcoma. Therefore, we cannot infer any indirect relationship between prednisolone and sarcoma from this sentence alone."
25621708,Prednisolone related to uveitis,212,Complement activation capacity in plasma before and during high-dose prednisolone treatment and tapering in exacerbations of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone related to uveitis' supported by the sentence: 'Complement activation capacity in plasma before and during high-dose prednisolone treatment and tapering in exacerbations of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.'?,"Yes, there is indirect support for the triple ""Prednisolone is related to uveitis"" based on the sentence provided, although it is not explicitly stated. The sentence discusses prednisolone treatment for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, which are conditions associated with uveitis, an inflammation of the eye often linked to autoimmune diseases like these two conditions. Therefore, prednisolone treatment could potentially influence uveitis through its impact on these diseases, but it is not directly stated in this sentence."

Prednisolone is an anti-inflammatory drug often used in treating various conditions, including autoimmune disorders, which could be relevant for thyroiditis. The fact that it was ineffective in treating this patient suggests it was not used for treating thyroiditis in this case, but rather as part of chemotherapy for lymphoma. However, this does not rule out the possibility that Prednisolone could be used in treating subacute thyroiditis in other contexts, hence the indirect support for the connection."
22194722,Prednisolone related to pulmonary eosinophilia,215,Effect of prednisolone in the experimentally induced nephropathy in male albino rats.,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone related to pulmonary eosinophilia' supported by the sentence: 'Effect of prednisolone in the experimentally induced nephropathy in male albino rats.'?,"No, the sentence does not support a direct or indirect relationship between Prednisolone and pulmonary eosinophilia.

20312000,Prednisolone related to chronic primary adrenal insufficiency,218,"Glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisolone) are cornerstones in the treatment of acute exacerbations of ulcerative colitis (UC), and influence of the leucocyte/endothelial interaction appears to be part of their mode of action.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone related to chronic primary adrenal insufficiency' supported by the sentence: 'Glucocorticoids (e.g. prednisolone) are cornerstones in the treatment of acute exacerbations of ulcerative colitis (UC), and influence of the leucocyte/endothelial interaction appears to be part of their mode of action.'?","Yes, there is indirect support for the connection between Prednisolone and chronic primary adrenal insufficiency in this sentence. Prednisolone is a type of glucocorticoid, which is used in the treatment of acute exacerbations of ulcerative colitis (UC). The mode of action for glucocorticoids in this context appears to involve influencing the leucocyte/endothelial interaction. 

         Chronic primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, is characterized by insufficient production of glucocorticoids (like prednisolone) from the adrenal glands. Therefore, while this sentence does not directly mention chronic primary adrenal insufficiency, it does provide context for how glucocorticoids like prednisolone function in the body, which is relevant to understanding their role in diseases like Addison's disease."
20106181,Prednisolone related to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,219,"Effects of honey, prednisolone, and disulfiram on inflammation, nitric oxide, and free radical formation.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone related to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis' supported by the sentence: 'Effects of honey, prednisolone, and disulfiram on inflammation, nitric oxide, and free radical formation.'?","Yes, there is indirect support for the connection between Prednisolone and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in this sentence, but only through inference based on contextual knowledge about these terms, not through direct mention in the sentence itself. Prednisolone is an anti-inflammatory drug often used in treating various conditions, including some respiratory disorders, while allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is an inflammatory respiratory disease caused by an immune response against Aspergillus fungi, which can lead to inflammation, nitric oxide, and free radical formation in lungs. The sentence discusses the effects of Prednisolone on inflammation, nitric oxide, and free radical formation, which is indirectly relevant to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, as these factors play an essential role in this disease progression. However, this sentence does not explicitly confirm Prednisolone's use in treating allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, so it is crucial not to overstate this connection without additional evidence from other sources."
19750187,Prednisolone related to lymphoma,220,OBJECTIVE: To assess the treatment effect of sodium hyaluronate (HA) on experimental temporomandibular joint (TMJ) osteoarthritis of rabbits in comparison with prednisolone (PS).,False,Is the triple 'Prednisolone related to lymphoma' supported by the sentence: 'OBJECTIVE: To assess the treatment effect of sodium hyaluronate (HA) on experimental temporomandibular joint (TMJ) osteoarthritis of rabbits in comparison with prednisolone (PS).'?,"No, this sentence does not provide any direct or indirect support for the statement that Prednisolone is related to lymphoma.

The sentence discusses prednisone and prednisolone clearance values in rabbits, which is not directly relevant to aplastic anemia in humans. Aplastic anemia is a condition characterized by a failure of the bone marrow to produce blood cells, while Prednisolone is a corticosteroid medication often used to treat various conditions such as inflammation, allergies, and autoimmune disorders. While Prednisolone may have side effects that affect blood cells, this sentence does not provide evidence for such a relationship."
16371065,Prednisolone related to celiac disease,225,"Budesonide is equal to less effective than prednisolone or prednisone therapy in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, but is associated with fewer glucocorticoids adverse reactions.",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone related to celiac disease' supported by the sentence: 'Budesonide is equal to less effective than prednisolone or prednisone therapy in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, but is associated with fewer glucocorticoids adverse reactions.'?","No, this sentence does not provide support for a relationship between Prednisolone and celiac disease.

The statement suggests that Prednisolone can prevent the development of colitis, implying it might have some protective effect against the conditions that lead to colitis, such as Crohn disease. However, it also indicates that Prednisolone does not affect already-developed colitis, which could suggest that it may not be as effective once the disease has progressed to this stage. This is only indirect evidence, as it does not directly state that Prednisolone is used for or is effective against Crohn disease, but it does suggest some sort of relationship between the two."
11638013,Prednisolone related to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis,239,Alveolar NO concentration was increased in patients with refractory asthma (7.1 ppb) compared with mild-to-moderate asthma (3.4 ppb) and normal controls (3.4 ppb) and reduced by treatment with prednisolone.,True,Is the triple 'Prednisolone related to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis' supported by the sentence: 'Alveolar NO concentration was increased in patients with refractory asthma (7.1 ppb) compared with mild-to-moderate asthma (3.4 ppb) and normal controls (3.4 ppb) and reduced by treatment with prednisolone.'?,"Yes, there is indirect support for a relationship between Prednisolone and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in this sentence. EGPA is often associated with severe asthma, which is characterized by increased alveolar nitric oxide (NO) concentrations. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid used in treating severe asthma, including EGPA, and it reduces alveolar NO concentrations, as indicated in the sentence. Therefore, Prednisolone could help manage EGPA symptoms, at least partly, by decreasing alveolar NO levels, although this is not explicitly stated in the sentence provided."
11213963,Prednisolone related to leprosy,240,"Prednisolone treatment of sensory impairment of the ulnar and posterior tibial nerves detectable with the monofilament test, but not with the ballpen test, did not improve the long-term outcome in terms of recovery of touch sensibility, not did it reduce the risk of leprosy reactions or nerve function impairment beyond the initial 4-month treatment phase.",False,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone related to leprosy' supported by the sentence: 'Prednisolone treatment of sensory impairment of the ulnar and posterior tibial nerves detectable with the monofilament test, but not with the ballpen test, did not improve the long-term outcome in terms of recovery of touch sensibility, not did it reduce the risk of leprosy reactions or nerve function impairment beyond the initial 4-month treatment phase.'?","No, this sentence does not provide support for a direct link between Prednisolone and leprosy. In fact, it suggests that Prednisolone treatment does not reduce the risk of leprosy reactions or nerve function impairment beyond the initial 4-month treatment phase in patients with sensory impairment detected through specific tests (the monofilament test but not the ballpen test). Therefore, it does not imply that Prednisolone is directly associated with preventing or treating leprosy itself, but rather it may have some effect on certain symptoms associated with sensory impairment in patients already affected by the disease during a specific time frame."

7800426,Prednisolone affects acute lymphoblastic leukemia,322,"Finally, transient pre-treatment of healthy humans with cortisol induces a bi-phasic response during a later, delayed systemic inflammatory response: an intermediate cortisol concentration augments inflammation while a high cortisol concentration is neither pro- nor anti-inflammatory.",True,"Is the triple 'Prednisolone affects acute lymphoblastic leukemia' supported by the sentence: 'Finally, transient pre-treatment of healthy humans with cortisol induces a bi-phasic response during a later, delayed systemic inflammatory response: an intermediate cortisol concentration augments inflammation while a high cortisol concentration is neither pro- nor anti-inflammatory.'?","Yes, this sentence does provide some indirect evidence for the idea that Prednisolone, which is a synthetic glucocorticoid similar to cortisol, could affect acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The sentence suggests that cortisol, which is known to have similar effects as Prednisolone, can modulate inflammation in humans. ALL is often associated with an overactive immune response, so it is plausible that modulating this response could have an impact on ALL. However, this is a very indirect link, and more specific research would be needed to directly support this claim."

25797574,Hydrocortisone related to lymphoma,347,"CIRCI is characterized by an inadequate production of cortisol in relation to an increased demand during periods of severe stress, particularly in critical illnesses such as sepsis or septic shock.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to lymphoma' supported by the sentence: 'CIRCI is characterized by an inadequate production of cortisol in relation to an increased demand during periods of severe stress, particularly in critical illnesses such as sepsis or septic shock.'?","Yes, there is indirect support for the connection between hydrocortisone, which is a form of cortisol, and lymphoma in this sentence. The sentence discusses CIRCI (Critical Illness-Related Corticosteroid Insufficiency), a condition characterized by an inadequate production of cortisol during periods of severe stress, particularly in critical illnesses such as sepsis or septic shock. Hydrocortisone is often used in medical settings as a replacement for cortisol in such conditions, as it has similar anti-inflammatory effects and can help manage symptoms. 

         Now, regarding lymphoma, it is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, including white blood cells (lymphocytes) which can be impacted by corticosteroids like hydrocortisone due to their immunosuppressive properties. This immunosuppression can potentially influence the progression, treatment, or symptoms experienced in certain types of lymphoma, providing an indirect link between hydrocortisone and this form of cancer. However, it is essential to note this connection is not direct, as hydrocortisone"

The sentence discusses the correlation between enhanced cortisol production rates, free cortisol, 11beta-HSD-1 expression, visceral fat, and insulin resistance in men, particularly in relation to weight loss. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid hormone produced by the adrenal gland, which plays a role in regulating stress response, metabolism, and immune response, among other functions, so there is an indirect connection through cortisol, but not specifically in relation to alcohol abuse."
19531872,Hydrocortisone related to atrial fibrillation,350,"Obesity is also related to dysregulation of cortisol production by the pre-receptor enzyme, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and we speculate that this may have a role in the pathogenesis of obesity and raised ICP seen in IIH.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to atrial fibrillation' supported by the sentence: 'Obesity is also related to dysregulation of cortisol production by the pre-receptor enzyme, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and we speculate that this may have a role in the pathogenesis of obesity and raised ICP seen in IIH.'?","Yes, there is an indirect relationship between Hydrocortisone and atrial fibrillation in the context of the sentence provided. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, which is closely related to cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal gland. The sentence mentions obesity being associated with dysregulation of cortisol production, which could potentially lead to conditions like obesity and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). 

         While not explicitly mentioned, there is evidence linking obesity and atrial fibrillation [1]. In this regard, Hydrocortisone could be indirectly linked to atrial fibrillation through its association with obesity due to cortisol dysregulation. However, it is important to note that this is speculative, as further research would be required to establish this relationship conclusively.

While the sentence primarily discusses corticosteroids in relation to asthma, it mentions stressors which promote chronic adult-onset asthma, which can lead to elevated cortisol production, thus implicating hydrocortisone in both conditions. Therefore, it can be inferred that hydrocortisone may have an impact on atopic dermatitis, given its role in cortisol production, which is relevant for both asthma and atopic dermatitis management."
14483328,Hydrocortisone related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia,354,Glucocorticoid insufficiency is common during sepsis and may result from insufficient production of cortisol or peripheral tissues resistance.,True,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to bronchopulmonary dysplasia' supported by the sentence: 'Glucocorticoid insufficiency is common during sepsis and may result from insufficient production of cortisol or peripheral tissues resistance.'?,"Yes, the sentence does indirectly support a relationship between hydrocortisone (a glucocorticoid) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). This is because BPD is often associated with sepsis, which can lead to glucocorticoid insufficiency due to insufficient cortisol production or peripheral tissues resistance. Hydrocortisone, as a glucocorticoid, could potentially be used to treat this insufficiency, thereby indirectly impacting BPD. However, this is a complex relationship and further research would be needed to fully understand it."

Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, which is produced in the adrenal cortex. The sentence suggests that a decrease in corticosteroid production (represented here as LTH, which stands for low-dose hydrocortisone therapy) is an adaptive response to prevent excessive cortisol production, which could restrict fetal growth and potentially induce preterm delivery. Therefore, there is an indirect relationship between hydrocortisone (a product of the adrenal cortex) and adrenal cortex neoplasm, as changes in corticosteroid production can have significant effects on fetal development, as mentioned in the sentence."

11089023,Hydrocortisone related to pancreatitis,366,"Under normal conditions, stress induces increased cortisol secretion that counteracts inflammatory reactions.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to pancreatitis' supported by the sentence: 'Under normal conditions, stress induces increased cortisol secretion that counteracts inflammatory reactions.'?","Yes, the statement is indirectly supported by this sentence. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, which is often referred to as the body's natural stress hormone. Cortisol, including synthetic forms like hydrocortisone, helps to counteract inflammatory reactions in the body. Pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas, so it is plausible that increased cortisol secretion could theoretically help to counteract this inflammation, thereby having an indirect relationship. However, it is important to note that this is a simplified explanation, and in reality, the relationship between stress, cortisol, and inflammatory conditions like pancreatitis is complex and can depend on many factors, including dosage, duration, and individual health conditions."

9238280,Hydrocortisone related to Sepsis,374,"CONCLUSION: In intubated trauma patients, the use of an intravenous stress-dose of hydrocortisone, compared with placebo, resulted in a decreased risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to Sepsis' supported by the sentence: 'CONCLUSION: In intubated trauma patients, the use of an intravenous stress-dose of hydrocortisone, compared with placebo, resulted in a decreased risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia.'?","Yes, there is indirect support for this statement. Hydrocortisone is an intravenous stress-dose steroid, which can help regulate the immune response in critically ill patients, such as those with sepsis. The sentence in question mentions its use in intubated trauma patients, which can include those with sepsis, leading to decreased hospital-acquired pneumonia risk, an infection commonly seen in sepsis patients due to weakened immune systems. Therefore, hydrocortisone could have an indirect effect on sepsis via immune system regulation, leading to reduced infection risk, as suggested in this sentence."

This implies that hydrocortisone might have some protective effect or influence on the post-surgical recovery process, which could include reducing inflammation or stress responses associated with injury. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference, as the sentence does not explicitly state that hydrocortisone is directly linked to injury reduction."
8778414,Hydrocortisone related to Inflammation,377,"Assuming a single dose of hydrocortisone improves sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin, it may be an interesting candidate for use in reducing insulin resistance in peripheral tissues of horses with several disease states.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to Inflammation' supported by the sentence: 'Assuming a single dose of hydrocortisone improves sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin, it may be an interesting candidate for use in reducing insulin resistance in peripheral tissues of horses with several disease states.'?","Yes, this sentence does indirectly support the idea that hydrocortisone is related to inflammation. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, which is often used to reduce inflammation in the body. The sentence mentions that hydrocortisone can improve sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin, which is a factor in several disease states, including inflammatory ones. Therefore, by improving insulin sensitivity, hydrocortisone could potentially help reduce inflammation in these diseases. However, this is an indirect relationship and further research would be needed to confirm this hypothesis."
8763179,Hydrocortisone related to toxic shock syndrome,378,Plasma cortisol and glucagon concentrations were not increased markedly except in a case complicated other systemic bacterial infection.,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to toxic shock syndrome' supported by the sentence: 'Plasma cortisol and glucagon concentrations were not increased markedly except in a case complicated other systemic bacterial infection.'?,"No, this sentence does not provide support for a relationship between hydrocortisone and toxic shock syndrome.

Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, which is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands as part of the body’s response to stress, including septic shock. In cases of adrenocortical insufficiency (also known as Addison’s disease), the body does not produce enough cortisol, making it challenging for individuals to respond effectively to stressful situations, including septic shock. Therefore, administering hydrocortisone in such cases could help manage symptoms associated with septic shock, providing indirect evidence for their relationship."
7573954,Hydrocortisone related to neoplasm,384,The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effect of stress doses of hydrocortisone during the initial phase of human septic shock on the serum values of the neurospecific protein S-100B in comparison to the inflammation markers interleukin (IL)-8 in serum and polymorphonuclear (PMN) elastase in plasma.,False,Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to neoplasm' supported by the sentence: 'The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effect of stress doses of hydrocortisone during the initial phase of human septic shock on the serum values of the neurospecific protein S-100B in comparison to the inflammation markers interleukin (IL)-8 in serum and polymorphonuclear (PMN) elastase in plasma.'?,"No, this sentence does not provide support for a direct relationship between hydrocortisone and neoplasm.

Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, which is involved in regulating metabolism, among other things, through its role as a hormonal precursor in cortisol production (a type of glucocorticoid). Glucocorticoids, such as cortisol, have been associated with weight gain, insulin resistance, and other metabolic disturbances when present in excess, such as in Cushing syndrome. The sentence provided discusses how cortisol, in combination with insulin, can contribute to energy deposition, which may lead to weight gain (or in this case, obesity) when there is an imbalance between energy intake (stimulated by insulin) and energy expenditure (inhibited by corticotropin-releasing factor). Therefore, hydrocortisone could be indirectly linked through its role in cortisol regulation, which in turn is connected to insulin-mediated energy deposition in the context of obesity development as described in the sentence."

Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, which is released in response to stress, including inflammation, and it has been linked to memory loss in postmenopausal women in this study. Therefore, it can be inferred that hydrocortisone, being a stress hormone, could be indirectly linked to inflammation, as stress can induce inflammatory responses in the body, and both can contribute to verbal memory loss in postmenopausal women."
24030854,Hydrocortisone related to Hypoxemia,387,"A growing body of evidence now suggests that endogenous cortisol, which is produced in significant quantities by the body in a diurnal rhythm, is an important regulator of allergic disease expression and allergic inflammatory responses: lung function varies along with plasma cortisol levels; the number of circulating inflammatory cells varies with plasma cortisol levels; and low levels of endogenous cortisol may be associated with risk for asthma.",True,"Is the triple 'Hydrocortisone related to Hypoxemia' supported by the sentence: 'A growing body of evidence now suggests that endogenous cortisol, which is produced in significant quantities by the body in a diurnal rhythm, is an important regulator of allergic disease expression and allergic inflammatory responses: lung function varies along with plasma cortisol levels; the number of circulating inflammatory cells varies with plasma cortisol levels; and low levels of endogenous cortisol may be associated with risk for asthma.'?","Yes, there is indirect support for the relationship between hydrocortisone (a synthetic form of cortisol) and hypoxemia (a condition characterized by low oxygen levels in the blood) in this sentence. This is because cortisol, which hydrocortisone mimics, is known to regulate allergic disease expression and inflammatory responses, including lung function and the number of circulating inflammatory cells, all of which can impact oxygen levels in the blood. Therefore, conditions associated with low levels of endogenous cortisol, such as asthma, could potentially be associated with hypoxemia. However, this is an indirect relationship and further research would be needed to directly link hydrocortisone to hypoxemia."
