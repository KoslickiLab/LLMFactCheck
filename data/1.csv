The study investigates the efficacy of various anthelmintics, including fenbendazole (FBZ), against gastrointestinal nematodes on two free-range layer farms in Australia. Helminthiasis is a condition characterized by parasitic worm infestation in various organs of the body, including gastrointestinal nematodes in the case of this study. The fact that fenbendazole is being tested for its efficacy against these nematodes suggests that it has potential therapeutic effects on helminthiasis caused by these parasites. However, it is important to note that direct evidence of fenbendazole treating helminthiasis in a clinical setting is not provided in this statement; thus, it only offers indirect support for the claim."
9783282,Thiabendazole treats helminthiasis,1002,[The treatment of helminthiasis with thiabendazole].,True,"'Does the phrase ""Thiabendazole treats helminthiasis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""[The treatment of helminthiasis with thiabendazole].""?","Yes, the phrase ""Thiabendazole treats helminthiasis"" does receive indirect support from the statement: ""[The treatment of helminthiasis with thiabendazole]."" This is because the statement explicitly mentions that thiabendazole is used in the treatment of helminthiasis, which implies that thiabendazole is an effective agent against helminthiasis. However, it is important to note that while this statement provides indirect evidence for thiabendazole's efficacy in treating helminthiasis, it does not constitute direct evidence of its therapeutic benefits, such as results from clinical trials demonstrating its safety and efficacy in patients."
22678969,Albendazole treats Infection,1003,The control of STH infections is based on preventive chemotherapy using either albendazole or mebendazole.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Albendazole treats Infection"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The control of STH infections is based on preventive chemotherapy using either albendazole or mebendazole.""?","Yes, the phrase ""Albendazole treats Infection"" does receive indirect support from the statement: ""The control of STH infections is based on preventive chemotherapy using either albendazole or mebendazole.""

         The statement suggests that albendazole is one of the primary drugs used in preventive chemotherapy for soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, which implies that it has therapeutic effects against these infections. This is consistent with the phrase ""Albendazole treats Infection."" However, it should be noted that the term ""treats"" in this context refers to the medical use of albendazole to manage or cure infections, rather than eradicating the infection immediately upon administration. Furthermore, it is essential to consider that albendazole is just one of several drugs used for treating STH infections; therefore, its effectiveness may vary depending on the specific type of infection and other factors."
10750815,Albendazole treats onchocerciasis,1004,"A double-blind clinical trial was conducted in Monagas State, Venezuela to assess the tolerance and efficacy of albendazole in the therapy of Onchocerca volvulus infection.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Albendazole treats onchocerciasis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""A double-blind clinical trial was conducted in Monagas State, Venezuela to assess the tolerance and efficacy of albendazole in the therapy of Onchocerca volvulus infection.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the claim that Albendazole treats onchocerciasis (Onchocerca volvulus infection). The reason is that a double-blind clinical trial is an experimental study design that aims to reduce bias when testing a treatment's efficacy. In this case, the trial assesses albendazole's tolerance and efficacy in treating Onchocerca volvulus infection (onchocerciasis).

         While the statement does not explicitly confirm that albendazole is an effective treatment for onchocerciasis, it does imply that an investigation into its therapeutic potential was conducted. The fact that such a study was performed suggests that there is some basis for believing albendazole may have some effect on onchocerciasis, even if it does not prove it conclusively.

         However, it is important to note that determining whether albendazole effectively treats onchocerciasis would require reviewing additional information such as the study results, methodology, sample size, control group details, and statistical analysis. This information would provide more direct evidence regarding albendazole"
10114050,Albendazole treats toxocariasis,1005,"The treatment of cutaneous larva migrans and Toxocara infection relies on antihelminthic agents such as thiabendazole, albendazole and ivermectin.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Albendazole treats toxocariasis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The treatment of cutaneous larva migrans and Toxocara infection relies on antihelminthic agents such as thiabendazole, albendazole and ivermectin.""?","Yes, the phrase ""Albendazole treats toxocariasis"" does receive indirect support from the statement: ""The treatment of cutaneous larva migrans and Toxocara infection relies on antihelminthic agents such as thiabendazole, albendazole and ivermectin.""

         The statement indicates that albendazole is one of the antihelminthic agents used in the treatment of cutaneous larva migrans and Toxocara infection. Toxocariasis is an infection caused by the roundworm parasite Toxocara, which can affect various organs in the body including the skin (cutaneous larva migrans). Therefore, it can be inferred that albendazole is used in treating toxocariasis because it is an effective antihelminthic agent against Toxocara infections. However, direct causality cannot be inferred from this statement alone as it only implies an association between albendazole usage and treatment of Toxocara infections."
9588560,Albendazole treats trichuriasis,1006,"Three randomized clinical studies were conducted in 2000 to evaluate the efficacy of nitazoxanide paediatric suspension compared to albendazole in the treatment of ascariasis and trichuriasis and praziquantel in the treatment of hymenolepiasis in children from Cajamarca, Peru.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Albendazole treats trichuriasis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Three randomized clinical studies were conducted in 2000 to evaluate the efficacy of nitazoxanide paediatric suspension compared to albendazole in the treatment of ascariasis and trichuriasis and praziquantel in the treatment of hymenolepiasis in children from Cajamarca, Peru.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the claim that albendazole treats trichuriasis. The randomized clinical studies mentioned in the statement compared albendazole to nitazoxanide paediatric suspension in treating ascariasis and trichuriasis in children from Cajamarca, Peru. The fact that albendazole was used as a comparator in these studies implies that it has some established efficacy against trichuriasis. However, it is important to note that these studies do not provide direct evidence of albendazole's efficacy against trichuriasis; they only suggest that it was considered an appropriate comparator for a drug being tested for trichuriasis treatment. Therefore, while there is indirect support for the claim, it is not based on direct comparative results between albendazole and a placebo in treating trichuriasis."
9492446,Albendazole treats filariasis,1007,"Today, the only way is the prophylactic control of Onchocerca vovulus infections and treating lymphatic filariosis with ivermectin, diethylcarbamacine, ivermectin/diethylcarbamazine. or ivermectin/albendazole combinations.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Albendazole treats filariasis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Today, the only way is the prophylactic control of Onchocerca vovulus infections and treating lymphatic filariosis with ivermectin, diethylcarbamacine, ivermectin/diethylcarbamazine. or ivermectin/albendazole combinations.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the claim that Albendazole treats filariasis. The statement lists several treatment options for lymphatic filariosis (a type of filariasis), one of which is the combination of ivermectin and albendazole. Therefore, it suggests that albendazole is indeed used in treating filariasis, even though it may not be the only drug used or the primary one mentioned in the statement. However, it is important to note that filariasis is caused by various species of filarial worms, including Onchocerca volvulus (which causes river blindness), and it is possible that albendazole is more effective against some species than others."
8712067,Albendazole treats helminthiasis,1008,The study population was assessed for helminthic infection and those found to be positive were randomly assigned to either an albendazole treatment group or a control group who received a placebo.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Albendazole treats helminthiasis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The study population was assessed for helminthic infection and those found to be positive were randomly assigned to either an albendazole treatment group or a control group who received a placebo.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the claim that Albendazole treats helminthiasis. This is because it describes a study where participants diagnosed with helminthic infection were given Albendazole as part of a treatment group, implying that Albendazole was used as an intervention for helminthiasis in this context. However, it is important to note that direct support would require additional information such as the outcomes of the treatment group compared to the control group (e.g., parasite clearance rates), as well as any relevant statistical analyses demonstrating significant differences between the two groups."
7789677,Albendazole treats strongyloidiasis,1009,"To determine the host factors involved in response to treatment, 46 patients with strongyloidiasis were treated with albendazole, followed-up for 1 year, and separated into two groups: cured and non-cured.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Albendazole treats strongyloidiasis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""To determine the host factors involved in response to treatment, 46 patients with strongyloidiasis were treated with albendazole, followed-up for 1 year, and separated into two groups: cured and non-cured.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Albendazole treats strongyloidiasis"". The fact that 46 patients diagnosed with strongyloidiasis were treated with albendazole indicates that albendazole is being used as a treatment for this condition. The follow-up period of one year and the separation of patients into cured and non-cured groups suggests that the study is assessing the efficacy of albendazole in treating strongyloidiasis. However, it is important to note that this statement does not provide direct evidence of albendazole's efficacy, as it does not report on the outcomes of the treatment. A direct claim would require explicit statements about the drug's effectiveness in treating strongyloidiasis."
7640018,Albendazole treats filarial elephantiasis,1010,The role of albendazole in programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Albendazole treats filarial elephantiasis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The role of albendazole in programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.""?","Yes, the statement ""The role of albendazole in programmes to eliminate lymphatic filariasis"" does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Albendazole treats filarial elephantiasis"". This is because filarial elephantiasis is caused by parasitic filarial worms, which lymphatic filariasis is a disease resulting from infection by these worms. Albendazole is an anthelmintic drug often used in mass drug administration programs for lymphatic filariasis elimination. By targeting and killing the microfilariae (immature filarial worms) in humans, albendazole can help reduce transmission of filarial worms and potentially improve symptoms of filarial elephantiasis over time. However, it is important to note that albendazole alone may not be sufficient to cure filarial elephantiasis, as it does not kill adult worms, and other treatments might be necessary for severe cases of elephantiasis."
7620262,Albendazole treats Hookworm Infections,1011,On the basis of our results the single 400 mg dose of albendazole is the treatment of choice for hookworm infections in this region of Mali.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Albendazole treats Hookworm Infections"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""On the basis of our results the single 400 mg dose of albendazole is the treatment of choice for hookworm infections in this region of Mali.""?","Yes, the phrase ""Albendazole treats Hookworm Infections"" does receive indirect support from the statement: ""On the basis of our results the single 400 mg dose of albendazole is the treatment of choice for hookworm infections in this region of Mali.""

         The statement suggests that albendazole is an effective treatment for hookworm infections in a specific region of Mali. This implies that albendazole has some therapeutic effect on hookworm infections, providing indirect support for the claim that albendazole treats hookworm infections. However, it's important to note that this support is indirect and limited to the specific context of the study (i.e., the region of Mali). Further research would be needed to determine whether albendazole is an effective treatment for hookworm infections in other regions and populations."
7226097,Albendazole treats cysticercosis,1012,The efficacy of albendazole (15 mg/kg/d for 1 week) was compared with praziquantel (100 mg/kg in three divided doses at 2-hour intervals) for therapy of parenchymal brain cysticercosis.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Albendazole treats cysticercosis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The efficacy of albendazole (15 mg/kg/d for 1 week) was compared with praziquantel (100 mg/kg in three divided doses at 2-hour intervals) for therapy of parenchymal brain cysticercosis.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the claim that albendazole treats cysticercosis. The study referenced in the statement is comparing the efficacy of albendazole and praziquantel in treating parenchymal brain cysticercosis, which implies that albendazole is being used as a treatment for cysticercosis in this context. However, it should be noted that direct support for the claim would require a statement explicitly stating that albendazole treats cysticercosis, rather than an indirect reference in a comparative study."
25678577,Latamoxef treats bacterial infectious disease,1013,"Clinical efficacy and safety of a new oxacephem, moxalactam, in serious bacterial infections.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Latamoxef treats bacterial infectious disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Clinical efficacy and safety of a new oxacephem, moxalactam, in serious bacterial infections.""?","Yes, there is indirect support for the statement ""Latamoxef treats bacterial infectious disease"" from the provided evidence. Latamoxef is an oxacephem antibiotic similar in structure and function to moxalactam. The statement ""Clinical efficacy and safety of a new oxacephem, moxalactam, in serious bacterial infections"" suggests that moxalactam is effective in treating bacterial infections. Since Latamoxef shares similar properties with moxalactam as an oxacephem antibiotic, it can be inferred that Latamoxef may also be effective in treating bacterial infections. However, it is important to note that direct clinical trials or studies comparing Latamoxef and bacterial infectious diseases would provide stronger support for this claim."
26824955,Ibuprofen treats spondylosis,1014,A comparison of the short-term effects of ibuprofen and diclofenac in spondylosis.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats spondylosis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""A comparison of the short-term effects of ibuprofen and diclofenac in spondylosis.""?","No, the statement ""A comparison of the short-term effects of ibuprofen and diclofenac in spondylosis"" does not provide direct support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats spondylosis."" The statement is comparing two treatments (ibuprofen and diclofenac) for spondylosis but it does not confirm that ibuprofen specifically treats spondylosis. It only suggests that ibuprofen might be more effective than diclofenac in treating spondylosis in the short term based on the comparison study. To confirm that ibuprofen treats spondylosis, there would need to be studies specifically investigating ibuprofen as a treatment for spondylosis."
25670779,Ibuprofen treats sunburn,1015,"The data suggest that ibuprofen is more effective than placebo for the relief of symptoms associated with UV-B-induced inflammation after high dose UV-B phototherapy for psoriasis, but the drug has limited usefulness in the treatment of sunburn reaction from these same doses.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats sunburn"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The data suggest that ibuprofen is more effective than placebo for the relief of symptoms associated with UV-B-induced inflammation after high dose UV-B phototherapy for psoriasis, but the drug has limited usefulness in the treatment of sunburn reaction from these same doses.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement provided. The key phrase indicating this is ""UV-B-induced inflammation after high dose UV-B phototherapy for psoriasis."" Sunburn is also an inflammatory response caused by UV-B radiation from sunlight exposure. Ibuprofen is known for its anti-inflammatory properties, which may alleviate symptoms associated with sunburn as well as those induced by phototherapy for psoriasis.

         However, it is essential to acknowledge certain nuances in interpreting these results for sunburn treatment specifically. The statement highlights that ibuprofen has ""limited usefulness in the treatment of sunburn reaction from these same doses."" This implies that while ibuprofen may provide some relief for sunburn symptoms, its overall effectiveness might be limited compared to other treatments specifically designed for sunburns.

         In summary, while there is indirect support for ibuprofen treating sunburn based on its effectiveness in relieving UV-B-induced inflammation in psoriasis patients undergoing phototherapy, it is crucial to recognize that its usefulness in treating sunburn might be limited compared to other targeted therap"

The statement suggests that ibuprofen, when used in combination with a specific recipe (Huoxue Huayu Recipe), can help reduce inflammatory factors in patients with ankle fractures. This implies that ibuprofen could potentially have a positive effect on treating fractured ankles by reducing inflammation, which is a key component of the healing process. However, it's important to note that the claim does not explicitly state that ibuprofen alone can treat fractured ankles, but rather that it is part of a treatment regimen. Therefore, while there is some indirect support for the claim, it is not a direct confirmation that ibuprofen alone can treat fractured ankles."
25321029,Ibuprofen treats bronchopulmonary dysplasia,1017,"Treatment of newborn rat pups with ibuprofen reduced pulmonary vessel density in the developing lung, but also attenuated experimental BPD by reducing lung inflammation, alveolar enlargement, alveolar septum thickness and small arteriolar wall thickening.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats bronchopulmonary dysplasia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Treatment of newborn rat pups with ibuprofen reduced pulmonary vessel density in the developing lung, but also attenuated experimental BPD by reducing lung inflammation, alveolar enlargement, alveolar septum thickness and small arteriolar wall thickening.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement provided. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is characterized by impaired alveolar development and lung inflammation in premature infants. The statement indicates that ibuprofen treatment in newborn rat pups led to reduced lung inflammation as well as attenuated experimental BPD, as evidenced by improvements in alveolar enlargement, alveolar septum thickness, and small arteriolar wall thickening. These results suggest that ibuprofen may have therapeutic potential for BPD treatment in humans; however, further studies are needed to confirm these effects in clinical settings before making definitive conclusions about its efficacy in treating BPD."
22125431,Ibuprofen treats preeclampsia,1018,Introduction:     The comparison of ibuprofen with acetaminophen for blood pressure (BP) in preeclampsia remains controversial.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats preeclampsia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Introduction:     The comparison of ibuprofen with acetaminophen for blood pressure (BP) in preeclampsia remains controversial.""?","No, the statement ""Ibuprofen treats preeclampsia"" does not receive indirect support from the provided statement. The statement in question only introduces a controversy regarding the comparison of ibuprofen with acetaminophen for blood pressure in preeclampsia. It does not confirm that ibuprofen is an effective treatment for preeclampsia. In fact, it implies that more research is needed to determine whether ibuprofen is superior, equivalent, or inferior to acetaminophen in managing blood pressure in preeclampsia patients. Therefore, it is important not to overstate conclusions based on limited evidence when interpreting scientific statements."
21268743,Ibuprofen treats glioma,1019,"Taken together, our findings reveal that ibuprofen could induce ferroptosis of glioblastoma cells via downregulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and is a potential drug for glioma treatment.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats glioma"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Taken together, our findings reveal that ibuprofen could induce ferroptosis of glioblastoma cells via downregulation of Nrf2 signaling pathway and is a potential drug for glioma treatment.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats glioma."" The statement suggests that ibuprofen could induce ferroptosis of glioblastoma cells, which are a type of glioma cell. Furthermore, it indicates that this could occur via downregulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway, suggesting a potential mechanism of action. However, it is important to note that while this statement provides some evidence in favor of the claim that ibuprofen can treat glioma, it does not constitute definitive proof. Further research would be needed to confirm these findings and establish the safety and efficacy of ibuprofen as a treatment for glioma."
20821983,Ibuprofen treats common cold,1020,Ibuprofen (IBU) and phenylephrine hydrochloride (PE) were commonly used for common cold due to their different effects in relieving fever and the main symptoms such as nasal congestion and high sinus pressure.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats common cold"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Ibuprofen (IBU) and phenylephrine hydrochloride (PE) were commonly used for common cold due to their different effects in relieving fever and the main symptoms such as nasal congestion and high sinus pressure.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats common cold."" The statement suggests that ibuprofen (IBU) is used for common colds due to its ability to relieve fever and certain symptoms such as nasal congestion and high sinus pressure. However, it does not imply that ibuprofen treats the cold itself; rather, it indicates that ibuprofen alleviates some of the symptoms associated with the common cold.

        To provide indirect support for ""Ibuprofen treats common cold,"" there would need to be evidence suggesting that ibuprofen has an impact on the underlying cause of the common cold (typically viruses) or that it reduces the duration of cold symptoms beyond what would be expected from simple symptom relief. The statement provided does not contain such evidence; therefore, it does not support the claim that ibuprofen treats common colds."
20285347,Ibuprofen treats periodontitis,1021,"Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the local delivery of the NSAIDs model drug ibuprofen to treat periodontitis using different types of gel formulations (hydrogel, oleogel, and bigel).",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats periodontitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the local delivery of the NSAIDs model drug ibuprofen to treat periodontitis using different types of gel formulations (hydrogel, oleogel, and bigel).""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats periodontitis."" The objective of the study as stated is to investigate the local delivery of ibuprofen to treat periodontitis using different types of gel formulations. This implies that ibuprofen is being used as a treatment for periodontitis in the context of this study. However, it's important to note that this does not constitute direct evidence that ibuprofen is an effective treatment for periodontitis. The study would need to report positive results for such a claim to be made."
19270581,Ibuprofen treats bone fracture,1022,Does the Use of Ibuprofen in Children with Extremity Fractures Increase their Risk for Bone Healing Complications?,False,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats bone fracture"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Does the Use of Ibuprofen in Children with Extremity Fractures Increase their Risk for Bone Healing Complications?""?","No, the statement ""Does the Use of Ibuprofen in Children with Extremity Fractures Increase their Risk for Bone Healing Complications?"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats bone fracture."" In fact, it suggests quite the opposite. This question implies that there might be an association between Ibuprofen use in children with fractures and complications in bone healing, which could indicate that Ibuprofen might not be beneficial for bone fracture treatment. However, it does not definitively prove that Ibuprofen has no positive effects on bone fractures; it merely highlights a potential risk that should be further investigated."
17621968,Ibuprofen treats Cognitive impairment,1023,"Finally, anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen ameliorated the peripheral surgical wounding-induced cognitive impairment in 18 month-old mice.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Cognitive impairment"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Finally, anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen ameliorated the peripheral surgical wounding-induced cognitive impairment in 18 month-old mice.""?","Yes, indirectly it does lend some support. The statement suggests that ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, had an ameliorative effect on cognitive impairment in mice that underwent peripheral surgical wounding. However, it's important to note that this is not a direct correlation between ibuprofen and cognitive impairment treatment in general. The cognitive impairment here is specifically linked to surgical wounding in mice, which may not translate directly to humans or other causes of cognitive impairment. Therefore, while suggestive, more extensive research would be needed to fully support the claim that ibuprofen treats cognitive impairment in all cases."
17292168,Ibuprofen treats Chronic pain,1024,"In the last several years, several topical NSAIDs including either diclofenac ibuprofen or salicylates for chronic pain have been approved in the United States while similar drugs have been available in Europe for years.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Chronic pain"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""In the last several years, several topical NSAIDs including either diclofenac ibuprofen or salicylates for chronic pain have been approved in the United States while similar drugs have been available in Europe for years.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Chronic pain"". The statement mentions that topical NSAIDs such as diclofenac ibuprofen have been approved in the United States for chronic pain relief. This implies that ibuprofen is effective in treating chronic pain as it is one of the NSAIDs approved for such use. However, it should be noted that this is an indirect inference because the statement does not explicitly state that ibuprofen treats chronic pain, but rather implies it through its approval for such use by regulatory bodies."
15258520,Ibuprofen treats cardiovascular disorder,1025,Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the most common cardiovascular abnormality of the preterm infant usually treated with ibuprofen (IBU).,True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats cardiovascular disorder"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the most common cardiovascular abnormality of the preterm infant usually treated with ibuprofen (IBU).""?","Yes, while the statement does not explicitly say that ibuprofen treats cardiovascular disorders, it implies that ibuprofen is used in the treatment of PDA, which is a cardiovascular abnormality. This suggests that ibuprofen has some therapeutic effect on cardiovascular disorders, providing indirect support for the claim. However, it is important to note that PDA is not a cardiovascular disorder in the same sense as conditions like hypertension or coronary artery disease. It is a congenital condition that often resolves on its own without treatment. Therefore, while the statement supports the use of ibuprofen in treating PDA, it does not necessarily support its use in treating other cardiovascular disorders."
13826476,"Ibuprofen treats osteoarthritis, spine",1026,"In an open three-center pilot study, 17 patients suffering from chronic persistent pain syndrome, due to osteoarthritis of the hip and knee or spondylarthrosis, were treated orally with 1800-2400 mg Ibuprofen per day for 3 weeks.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats osteoarthritis, spine"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""In an open three-center pilot study, 17 patients suffering from chronic persistent pain syndrome, due to osteoarthritis of the hip and knee or spondylarthrosis, were treated orally with 1800-2400 mg Ibuprofen per day for 3 weeks.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats osteoarthritis, spine"". The study mentions that 17 patients suffering from chronic persistent pain syndrome due to osteoarthritis of the hip and knee or spondylarthrosis were treated with Ibuprofen for 3 weeks. Spondylarthrosis is a form of osteoarthritis that affects the spine. Therefore, this study demonstrates that Ibuprofen was used to treat osteoarthritis in the spine, providing indirect evidence for the claim. However, it is important to note that this is an open three-center pilot study with a small sample size of 17 patients, which limits the strength of the evidence provided. A more robust study design, such as a randomized controlled trial, would be needed for stronger evidence."
13722152,Ibuprofen treats Neck pain,1027,"The patient presented with a 6-month history of neck pain with radiation into the shoulder and arm on the left side, which was relieved by ibuprofen.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Neck pain"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The patient presented with a 6-month history of neck pain with radiation into the shoulder and arm on the left side, which was relieved by ibuprofen.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Neck pain."" The patient's relief from neck pain upon taking ibuprofen suggests that ibuprofen has some therapeutic effect on neck pain. However, it is important to note that this is an observational statement from a single patient, not a controlled study. Therefore, while it suggests a potential benefit of ibuprofen for neck pain, it does not prove that ibuprofen is a definitive treatment for neck pain. Other factors could also be contributing to the patient's relief, such as the natural course of the condition or other interventions received concurrently."
11790277,Ibuprofen treats hypertensive disorder,1028,"Treatment with nonselective anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen, indomethacin, or salicylic acid did not show any effect on angiotensin II-induced superoxide production, hypertension, or cardiac hypertrophy.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats hypertensive disorder"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Treatment with nonselective anti-inflammatory drugs ibuprofen, indomethacin, or salicylic acid did not show any effect on angiotensin II-induced superoxide production, hypertension, or cardiac hypertrophy.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats hypertensive disorder"". The provided statement discusses a study where treatment with nonselective anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen, did not show any effect on angiotensin II-induced superoxide production, hypertension, or cardiac hypertrophy. This suggests that ibuprofen may not be effective in treating hypertensive disorder in this specific context. However, it is important to note that hypertension is a complex condition that can be influenced by many factors, so further research would be needed to make definitive conclusions about ibuprofen's effectiveness in treating hypertension in all cases."
11536369,Ibuprofen treats seasonal allergic rhinitis,1029,Addition of ibuprofen to pseudoephedrine and chlorpheniramine in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats seasonal allergic rhinitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Addition of ibuprofen to pseudoephedrine and chlorpheniramine in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats seasonal allergic rhinitis."" The addition of ibuprofen to other treatments (pseudoephedrine and chlorpheniramine) suggests that ibuprofen has some therapeutic effect on seasonal allergic rhinitis. However, it is important to note that this does not directly prove that ibuprofen alone can treat seasonal allergic rhinitis as it may be more effective in combination with other medications. Additionally, further research would be needed to confirm its efficacy as a standalone treatment for seasonal allergic rhinitis."
11381904,Ibuprofen treats Premature birth,1030,This should be considered to assess pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of ibuprofen in premature neonates and subsequently to understand and refine the use of ibuprofen in managing PDA either as a prophylactic or curative treatment.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Premature birth"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""This should be considered to assess pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of ibuprofen in premature neonates and subsequently to understand and refine the use of ibuprofen in managing PDA either as a prophylactic or curative treatment.""?","No, the statement does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Premature birth."" The statement discusses assessing pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of ibuprofen in premature neonates and refining its use in managing Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). While PDA is common in premature infants, treating PDA is not equivalent to treating premature birth itself. Therefore, the statement does not support the claim that ibuprofen treats premature birth."

The statement discusses an observation of a patient who experienced an improvement in her chronic cough after taking ibuprofen prescribed for back pain. However, it does not establish any causal relationship between ibuprofen consumption and back pain relief, nor does it provide evidence that ibuprofen specifically treats back pain in general. The observation could be explained by various factors such as placebo effect, confounding factors, or even coincidence. Therefore, it is not appropriate to draw conclusions about ibuprofen's effectiveness in treating back pain based solely on this statement."
10195210,Ibuprofen treats influenza,1032,"A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group comparison of diclofenac-K and ibuprofen for the treatment of adults with influenza-like symptoms.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats influenza"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled, parallel-group comparison of diclofenac-K and ibuprofen for the treatment of adults with influenza-like symptoms.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats influenza."" The study mentioned in the statement is comparing diclofenac-K and ibuprofen for treating adults with influenza-like symptoms, not proving that ibuprofen can treat influenza itself. The study is designed to compare the efficacy of these two drugs in alleviating symptoms associated with influenza-like illnesses but does not necessarily imply that ibuprofen has antiviral properties against influenza virus. Further research would be required to establish such a claim conclusively."
9950431,Ibuprofen treats rheumatic disorder,1033,"Eight preparations contained synthetic drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants in sedative preparations, cyproheptadine in a remedy to gain bodyweight, ibuprofen and dipyrone in herbal capsules used to treat rheumatism).",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats rheumatic disorder"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Eight preparations contained synthetic drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants in sedative preparations, cyproheptadine in a remedy to gain bodyweight, ibuprofen and dipyrone in herbal capsules used to treat rheumatism).""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats rheumatic disorder"". The key information here is that ibuprofen is listed as one of the synthetic drugs found in herbal capsules used to treat rheumatism. This implies that ibuprofen is being used as a therapeutic agent for rheumatic disorders, which aligns with the claim that ibuprofen can treat such conditions. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference based on the usage of ibuprofen in these herbal capsules, rather than a direct statement about ibuprofen's efficacy in treating rheumatic disorders. For a more definitive conclusion, clinical trial data or similar direct evidence would be required."
9913360,Ibuprofen treats Myalgia,1034,Preliminary comparison of bromelain and Ibuprofen for delayed onset muscle soreness management.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Myalgia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Preliminary comparison of bromelain and Ibuprofen for delayed onset muscle soreness management.""?","Yes, the statement ""Preliminary comparison of bromelain and Ibuprofen for delayed onset muscle soreness management"" does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Myalgia."" 

        The statement implies that Ibuprofen is being studied for its potential effects on delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS), which is also known as myalgia. While it does not explicitly state that Ibuprofen is effective in treating myalgia, it does suggest that there is ongoing research into its potential therapeutic benefits for muscle soreness. This is consistent with the broader understanding in the medical community that Ibuprofen is often used as an analgesic (pain reliever) and anti-inflammatory drug, which can help alleviate symptoms of myalgia. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of Ibuprofen in treating myalgia would need to be established through rigorous clinical trials and studies."
9550056,Ibuprofen treats Acute Pain,1035,"BACKGROUND: Rofecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of acute pain, with similar analgesic efficacy to ibuprofen and naproxen sodium.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Acute Pain"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""BACKGROUND: Rofecoxib is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of acute pain, with similar analgesic efficacy to ibuprofen and naproxen sodium.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Acute Pain"". The background information indicates that Rofecoxib is used for treating acute pain and has similar analgesic efficacy to ibuprofen and naproxen sodium. Since ibuprofen has been mentioned in conjunction with an analgesic (pain-relieving) effect that is similar to Rofecoxib, it can be inferred that ibuprofen does have some level of efficacy in treating acute pain as well. However, it is important to note that direct experimental evidence demonstrating ibuprofen's effect on acute pain would provide stronger support for that statement."
9536612,Ibuprofen treats Low back pain,1036,CONCLUSION: Continuous low-level heat wrap therapy was superior to both acetaminophen and ibuprofen for treating low back pain.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Low back pain"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""CONCLUSION: Continuous low-level heat wrap therapy was superior to both acetaminophen and ibuprofen for treating low back pain.""?","Yes, indirectly it does support the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Low back pain"". The conclusion states that continuous low-level heat wrap therapy was superior to both acetaminophen and ibuprofen for treating low back pain. However, it does not mean that ibuprofen is ineffective for treating low back pain; rather, it suggests that there might be other treatments that are more effective. Therefore, the statement provides indirect evidence that ibuprofen can treat low back pain since it is mentioned as an option for treatment, albeit not as effective as others in this particular study."
9444914,Ibuprofen treats Arthralgia,1037,"To determine the effectiveness of oral glucosamine with ibuprofen for the relief of joint pain in osteoarthritis a mini-review (Griffiths, 2002) of double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing the two was undertaken.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Arthralgia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""To determine the effectiveness of oral glucosamine with ibuprofen for the relief of joint pain in osteoarthritis a mini-review (Griffiths, 2002) of double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing the two was undertaken.""?","No, the statement does not provide direct or indirect support for the claim that ""Ibuprofen treats Arthralgia"". The mini-review conducted by Griffiths in 2002 focuses on comparing oral glucosamine with ibuprofen for relief of joint pain in osteoarthritis specifically. Arthralgia refers generally to joint pain, which can be caused by various factors beyond osteoarthritis. Therefore, while the study might provide evidence for ibuprofen being effective in treating joint pain related to osteoarthritis, it does not extend to supporting its effectiveness in treating arthralgia in general."

The conclusion drawn in the statement is about NCX-2216 being more efficacious than ibuprofen in clearing Abeta deposits from the brains of Tg mice, implying potential benefit in treating Alzheimer's dementia. However, it does not indicate that ibuprofen itself is an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease; rather it suggests that NCX-2216 is more effective than ibuprofen in treating Alzheimer's-related pathology in mice.

        It is important to note that while ibuprofen has been shown in some studies to have potential neuroprotective effects (Lim et al., 2000), its impact on Alzheimer disease progression in humans remains unclear (McGeer et al., 1996). Further investigation is required before making any definitive conclusions about ibuprofen as an Alzheimer disease treatment in humans.

This is because lung injury is a type of injury, and ibuprofen was found to attenuate (reduce) it in specific circumstances (endotoxemic, neutropenic rats). However, it is important to note that this finding does not directly demonstrate that ibuprofen is effective in treating all types of injuries in all species, including humans. Further research would be needed to establish such broad applicability."

The conclusion states that continuous low-level topical heat therapy was as effective as ibuprofen for treating dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation). This implies that ibuprofen is indeed an effective treatment for dysmenorrhea. Therefore, the statement ""Ibuprofen treats Dysmenorrhea"" is supported by this conclusion, although it should be noted that it is not the primary focus of the study."

The statement ""Is the combination of ibuprofen and caffeine effective for the treatment of tension-type headache?"" implies that ibuprofen alone (since caffeine is not always necessary for treatment) can be effective in treating tension-type headaches. This is because if ibuprofen were not effective against tension-type headaches, then adding caffeine would not necessarily improve its efficacy. Therefore, the statement provides indirect evidence that ibuprofen can treat tension-type headaches. However, it is important to note that direct evidence would come from studies specifically examining ibuprofen without caffeine for tension-type headaches."
8452594,Ibuprofen treats migraine disorder,1042,"Evaluation of a novel solubilized formulation of ibuprofen in the treatment of migraine headache: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats migraine disorder"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Evaluation of a novel solubilized formulation of ibuprofen in the treatment of migraine headache: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats migraine disorder"". The study mentioned is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study - all of which are rigorous methodologies that lend credibility to the results. If the study found that ibuprofen was effective in treating migraine headaches, then it can be inferred that ibuprofen has some therapeutic effect on migraine disorder. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference, as the statement does not explicitly say that ibuprofen treats migraine disorder, but rather that it is effective in treating migraine headaches in a specific study context."
8420965,Ibuprofen treats Hemorrhage,1043,"A randomized trial measuring fecal blood loss after treatment with rofecoxib, ibuprofen, or placebo in healthy subjects.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Hemorrhage"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""A randomized trial measuring fecal blood loss after treatment with rofecoxib, ibuprofen, or placebo in healthy subjects.""?","No, the statement does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Hemorrhage."" The study mentioned is investigating fecal blood loss in healthy subjects after treatment with rofecoxib, ibuprofen, or placebo. This does not necessarily imply that ibuprofen treats hemorrhage; it only shows that there is an association between ibuprofen intake and fecal blood loss in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. To establish that ibuprofen treats hemorrhage, there would need to be evidence showing that ibuprofen reduces hemorrhage in patients suffering from it, as well as an understanding of its underlying mechanism of action in that context."
8397426,Ibuprofen treats rheumatoid arthritis,1044,Ibuprofen or aspirin in rheumatoid arthritis therapy.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats rheumatoid arthritis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Ibuprofen or aspirin in rheumatoid arthritis therapy.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement ""Ibuprofen or aspirin in rheumatoid arthritis therapy."" This is because ibuprofen is mentioned as one of the options for therapy in treating rheumatoid arthritis, which implies that it has some efficacy in managing symptoms of this condition. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of a claim. The statement does not provide specific details about the extent of ibuprofen's therapeutic effect on rheumatoid arthritis compared to other treatments, nor does it mention any potential side effects or risks associated with its use in this context. Therefore, further investigation would be necessary to fully substantiate the claim that ""Ibuprofen treats rheumatoid arthritis."""

The reason is that ibuprofen was included in a clinical study as an active comparator against ginger extract for treating osteoarthritis of the hip or knee. The fact that ibuprofen was selected for such a study suggests that it has an established therapeutic effect on osteoarthritis, which is consistent with the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats osteoarthritis"". However, it is important to note that the statement does not offer direct evidence of ibuprofen's efficacy in treating osteoarthritis within the context of this specific study since it does not provide any results or outcomes of the comparison between ibuprofen, ginger extract, and placebo."

The statement mentions that ""inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis such as ibuprofen and naproxen"" are approved for the treatment of HAH (High Altitude Headache). This implies that ibuprofen is effective in treating at least one type of headache, namely HAH, which is a form of headache. Therefore, it can be inferred that ibuprofen has therapeutic effects on headaches. However, it is important to note that headaches can be caused by various factors, and what works for one type may not work for another. Therefore, while there is support for ibuprofen as a treatment for some types of headaches, it is not necessarily indicative of its effectiveness for all types of headaches."

The statement indicates that there is an ongoing study investigating the effect of intravenous ibuprofen on treating patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in preterm infants, specifically focusing on its impact on mesenteric and renal blood flow velocity. The fact that such a study is being conducted implies that there is some basis for believing that ibuprofen could have therapeutic effects on PDA. However, it's important to note that until the results of this study (or any similar studies) are available and thoroughly evaluated, any definitive conclusions about ibuprofen's effectiveness in treating PDA would be premature."
7732956,Ibuprofen treats Pain,1048,"The WOMAC detected significant differences between ibuprofen and placebo for pain and physical functioning, whereas the SF-36 detected differences for the bodily pain subscale.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Pain"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The WOMAC detected significant differences between ibuprofen and placebo for pain and physical functioning, whereas the SF-36 detected differences for the bodily pain subscale.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Pain"". The WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index) detected significant differences between ibuprofen and placebo for pain and physical functioning. This suggests that ibuprofen is effective in treating pain compared to a placebo. Furthermore, the SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey) also detected differences for the bodily pain subscale, which further strengthens the argument that ibuprofen has an impact on pain reduction. However, it is important to note that while these results suggest that ibuprofen can alleviate pain, they do not necessarily prove that it treats the underlying cause of pain."
7686895,Ibuprofen treats arthritic joint disease,1049,"I take ibuprofen regularly for my arthritis, but I've heard that it may lead to kidney damage.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats arthritic joint disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""I take ibuprofen regularly for my arthritis, but I've heard that it may lead to kidney damage.""?","Yes, indirectly it does lend support to the claim that ibuprofen can help treat arthritic joint disease. The user's statement indicates they use ibuprofen regularly for their arthritis, which suggests that they find it effective in managing their symptoms. However, the statement also highlights potential side effects of long-term ibuprofen use, in this case, kidney damage. This doesn't negate its effectiveness in treating arthritis but rather emphasizes the need for careful use under medical supervision due to potential side effects.

        
        The user's statement is an anecdotal piece of evidence, meaning it comes from personal experience rather than controlled scientific studies. While anecdotal evidence can provide useful insights, it should be corroborated by rigorous scientific research before drawing definitive conclusions. Therefore, while the user's statement does provide some level of support for ibuprofen's effectiveness in treating arthritic joint disease, further investigation is required for more robust substantiation of this claim."
7258310,Ibuprofen treats Fever,1050,Paracetamol or ibuprofen in febrile children.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats Fever"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Paracetamol or ibuprofen in febrile children.""?","Yes, the phrase ""Ibuprofen treats fever"" does receive indirect support from the statement ""Paracetamol or ibuprofen in febrile children."" This is because both ibuprofen and paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) are commonly used as antipyretics, which means they help reduce fever. The statement suggests that either of these two medications can be used in febrile children, implying that both have antipyretic effects. Therefore, it indirectly supports the claim that ibuprofen treats fever. However, it's important to note that while ibuprofen can help reduce fever, it should be used appropriately and under medical supervision, especially in children, due to potential side effects and dosage considerations."

The study mentioned compares the analgesic efficacy (pain-relieving ability) of ibuprofen in patients with dental pain. The fact that ibuprofen was included in the study suggests that it has some analgesic effect on dental pain, which is often associated with toothache. However, it's important to note that while this study provides some evidence for ibuprofen's effectiveness in treating toothache, it doesn't conclusively prove it. For a more definitive conclusion, one would need to consider the full body of evidence available on this topic."

The statement is actually negatively framed, suggesting that ivabradine does not have beneficial effects on cardiac and vascular function in experimental septic shock. Septic shock is a severe form of sepsis that can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death, but it is not equivalent to toxic shock syndrome (TSS), which is a distinct condition typically caused by certain types of bacteria producing exotoxins. While both conditions involve dysfunction of the cardiovascular system, they have different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Therefore, evidence of ivabradine's effects on one condition does not necessarily translate to its effectiveness in treating the other condition."

The statement suggests that ivabradine can be used effectively and safely in patients with mitral valve stenosis (MS) who have normal sinus rhythm and cannot tolerate or have contraindications for beta-blocker therapy. However, it does not imply that ivabradine treats mitral valve stenosis itself; rather, it indicates that ivabradine can be an alternative treatment for heart rate control in specific patient populations with MS.

        The statement comes from a study that evaluated ivabradine in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) who had intolerance or contraindications for beta-blockers (Fox KM et al., 2014). The researchers found that ivabradine reduced heart rate and hospitalizations in these patients without significantly affecting their symptoms or exercise capacity compared to placebo.

In fact, it suggests quite the opposite. The word ""ineffective"" implies that ivabradine does not have a positive impact on atrial fibrillation, which contradicts the idea that it treats the condition. Therefore, these two statements are not consistent with each other."

The aim of the study is to compare the therapeutic effects of ivabradine in diastolic heart failure with preserved left ventricular systolic function. This implies that ivabradine is being used as a treatment for diastolic heart failure in the context of this study. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy. The results of the study itself would need to be evaluated in order to make any conclusions about whether ivabradine is an effective treatment for diastolic heart failure."

The MODI (f)Y trial is studying ivabradine as a pure heart rate reducing agent in MODS patients, implying that ivabradine may have therapeutic potential for treating MODS by targeting heart rate reduction. However, it is important to note that further investigation is needed before making definitive conclusions about ivabradine as an effective treatment for MODS since the statement only refers to an ongoing trial without reporting any results or outcomes."

This is because it implies that ivabradine is being used as part of a treatment regimen for systolic heart failure patients who are already receiving guideline-based therapy. However, it does not directly confirm that ivabradine is solely responsible for treating systolic heart failure, as it could be part of a larger treatment plan. It is important to note that further investigation into clinical trials and studies would be necessary to confirm ivabradine's efficacy in treating systolic heart failure."

The provided statement mentions that clinical studies have proven the efficacy of ivabradine in patients with stable angina. Additionally, it is noted that clinical data is awaited to verify its probable value in the treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias and tachycardia due to ventricular dysfunction. Although direct evidence supporting ivabradine's effectiveness in treating tachycardia is not provided in this statement, it does imply that there is existing evidence for its use in treating certain conditions that involve abnormal heart rhythms (such as stable angina) and suggests ongoing evaluation for its application in treating tachycardia specifically due to atrial tachyarrhythmias and ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, one could infer indirect support for ivabradine treating tachycardia based on its known efficacy in related conditions and ongoing clinical evaluation for its use in treating tachycardia due to specific causes."
12424888,Ivabradine treats coronary artery disorder,1061,"The effective drug, ivabradine, has demonstrated anti-anginal, anti-ischemic efficacy and now is being tested for its effect on survival in patients with coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function, as well as for heart failure.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ivabradine treats coronary artery disorder"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The effective drug, ivabradine, has demonstrated anti-anginal, anti-ischemic efficacy and now is being tested for its effect on survival in patients with coronary artery disease and impaired left ventricular function, as well as for heart failure.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ivabradine treats coronary artery disorder"". The statement mentions that ivabradine has demonstrated anti-anginal and anti-ischemic efficacy in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who have impaired left ventricular function as well as heart failure. These properties suggest that ivabradine can help manage symptoms and complications associated with CAD, thus providing some level of treatment for the disorder itself.

         However, it is important to note that while the statement supports ivabradine as an effective drug for managing symptoms of CAD, it does not explicitly claim that ivabradine cures coronary artery disorder. The ongoing clinical trials for ivabradine in patients with CAD and impaired left ventricular function as well as heart failure indicate that further investigation is required to establish its impact on patient survival rates and overall treatment of CAD.

         In summary, while not an explicit endorsement of ivabradine as a cure for coronary artery disorder, the statement does provide indirect support for its therapeutic value in treating symptoms associated with CAD."
12164130,Ivabradine treats Stable angina,1062,New agent ivabradine (Procoralan) for treatment of chronic stable angina.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Ivabradine treats Stable angina"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""New agent ivabradine (Procoralan) for treatment of chronic stable angina.""?","Yes, the phrase ""Ivabradine treats Stable angina"" does receive indirect support from the statement: ""New agent ivabradine (Procoralan) for treatment of chronic stable angina.""

         The statement explicitly mentions ivabradine as a new agent for treating chronic stable angina. This implies that ivabradine has been found effective in treating chronic stable angina in some capacity. Therefore, it lends indirect support to the claim that ivabradine treats stable angina. However, it should be noted that this is an indirect inference based on one statement alone. For a more robust conclusion, it would be necessary to consider additional evidence from clinical trials, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews that demonstrate the efficacy of ivabradine in treating stable angina."

This is because it suggests that ivabradine has a specific mechanism of action (inhibition of I(f) current) that can lower heart rate, which is often implicated in various cardiovascular disorders. Therefore, by reducing heart rate through this mechanism, ivabradine could potentially provide therapeutic benefits in the context of cardiovascular disease. However, it is important to note that while this statement supports the potential therapeutic use of ivabradine in cardiovascular disorders, it does not necessarily confirm that ivabradine treats all cardiovascular disorders; further research would be required to establish its efficacy in specific cardiovascular conditions."

The statement indicates that Cefixime is at least as effective as Penicillin V in treating pharyngitis and tonsillitis in children. This implies that Cefixime has therapeutic effects on tonsillitis, thus providing indirect support for the claim that Cefixime treats tonsillitis. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect inference based on a broader clinical trial result, and direct clinical trials specifically investigating Cefixime's effect on tonsillitis would provide stronger support for the claim."

The study aims to evaluate Cefixime for treating osteoarticular infections specifically in pediatric patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). This implies that Cefixime is being considered as a potential treatment for these infections, thus providing indirect evidence that Cefixime may have therapeutic effects against certain types of infections. However, it is important to note that direct evidence of Cefixime's efficacy in treating infections would require clinical trial results demonstrating its safety and efficacy in treating infections in human subjects."
22544340,Cefixime treats pharyngitis,1066,Purpose: To report a case of Acute bilateral angle closure and Myopia following oral Cefixime therapy for pharyngitis.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Cefixime treats pharyngitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Purpose: To report a case of Acute bilateral angle closure and Myopia following oral Cefixime therapy for pharyngitis.""?","No, the statement ""Purpose: To report a case of Acute bilateral angle closure and Myopia following oral Cefixime therapy for pharyngitis"" does not provide direct or indirect support for the claim that ""Cefixime treats pharyngitis."" 

        This statement is actually reporting an adverse event following Cefixime therapy for pharyngitis. It does not provide any information about the efficacy of Cefixime in treating pharyngitis. Therefore, it does not support the claim that Cefixime is an effective treatment for pharyngitis. 

        It is important to note that while a drug may have side effects that suggest it has a certain mechanism of action (in this case, potentially affecting eye pressure), this does not necessarily mean that it is effective in treating the condition it is being used for (pharyngitis). The drug could be having an off-target effect that is unrelated to its therapeutic effect. 

        In conclusion, while reports of adverse events can provide valuable information about drug safety, they do not necessarily provide information about drug efficacy. Therefore, they cannot be used as evidence to support"

The discussion revolves around a Phase 2 trial demonstrating the efficacy of cefixime in treating active syphilis in non-pregnant women. This trial will inform a proposed randomized controlled trial to evaluate cefixime as an alternative treatment for pregnant women with active syphilis, aiming to prevent congenital syphilis. The fact that clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate cefixime as a treatment for syphilis indicates that there is some basis for believing that cefixime could be an effective treatment for syphilis. However, it is important to note that these trials are still in progress, so any conclusions drawn from them would be considered preliminary until they have been subjected to rigorous peer review and replication."

The randomized trial mentioned in the statement is comparing two different treatments for gonorrhea - ciprofloxacin and cefixime - in a population where ciprofloxacin resistance has emerged. This implies that cefixime is being used as a treatment option for gonorrhea in this context, therefore supporting the claim that cefixime can treat gonorrhea. However, it's important to note that this is indirect evidence and does not provide direct proof of cefixime's efficacy in treating gonorrhea. The trial would need to report positive outcomes for cefixime for it to be considered direct evidence."

The statement suggests that when Trimetazidine is administered concurrently with doxorubicin, it significantly reduces the cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin. This implies that Trimetazidine has a protective effect against cardiotoxicity, which aligns with the concept of treating cardiotoxicity. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference based on one specific context (i.e., in combination with doxorubicin). Further research would be needed to confirm whether Trimetazidine has similar effects in other contexts and more broadly in treating cardiotoxicity."

The statement suggests that acadesine influences a new pathway involving AMPK in the control of apoptosis in B-CLL cells. Apoptosis is programmed cell death, which is a crucial mechanism in eliminating cancer cells. Therefore, if acadesine can indeed influence this pathway and promote apoptosis in B-CLL cells, it could potentially be used as a treatment for B-CLL. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect inference based on preliminary results, and further rigorous experimental studies are required to establish acadesine as an effective treatment for B-CLL."

The TERISA (Type 2 Diabetes Evaluation of Ranolazine in Subjects With Chronic Stable Angina) randomized clinical trial investigates the effects of ranolazine in patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic stable angina. The presence of such a study suggests that there is an interest in understanding ranolazine's potential therapeutic benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

        
        However, it is essential to note that the statement does not explicitly confirm that ranolazine treats type 2 diabetes mellitus. The trial might focus on other outcomes like changes in HbA1c levels, insulin sensitivity, or other diabetes-related complications as secondary endpoints. Therefore, while there is some indirect support for the notion that ranolazine may have implications for type 2 diabetes mellitus management, further investigation is required to establish whether it indeed ""treats"" type 2 diabetes mellitus as claimed.

        
        In summary, although indirect support exists based on the provided statement, it is crucial not to overstate the"

         The statement suggests that ranolazine has potential therapeutic benefits for diastolic heart failure. While it does not explicitly state that ranolazine treats diastolic heart failure, it implies that ranolazine could be an effective treatment option for this condition. Therefore, there is indirect support for the claim that ranolazine treats diastolic heart failure based on the provided statement.

         However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive evidence of efficacy. Further investigation and rigorous clinical trials would be necessary to establish ranolazine as a definitive treatment for diastolic heart failure."

The key phrase here is ""long QT syndromes"", which implies that ranolazine may have a potential therapeutic role in treating these syndromes. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference based on a broad categorization of various cardiac conditions, including long QT syndromes. 

        The statement refers to ""small clinical trials"", which suggests that the evidence base is preliminary and more extensive studies may be needed to confirm these findings. Furthermore, it includes other conditions such as non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome and atrial fibrillation, which could suggest that ranolazine has broader cardiovascular effects rather than being specifically targeted at long QT syndromes. 

        Therefore, while there is some support for the claim based on this statement, it is not definitive proof and should be interpreted in the context of the broader scientific literature on ranolazine and long QT syndromes."

The text mentions that recent studies have increased interest in fast-unbinding Na(+) channel blockers like vernakalant (RSD1235) and ranolazine for atrial fibrillation (AF) therapy. This implies that these drugs have been studied in relation to AF treatment, which includes ranolazine. However, it is important to note that while there is some support for the claim that ranolazine is being considered for AF therapy, the statement does not provide direct evidence that ranolazine treats atrial fibrillation effectively. The mechanism of efficacy is also stated as poorly understood, which suggests that further research is needed to fully support the claim that ranolazine treats atrial fibrillation."

This is because treatment is often synonymous with management in medical contexts. However, it is important to note that ""management"" can also include non-pharmacological interventions and may not necessarily imply that Ranolazine is solely responsible for treating coronary artery disease. Additionally, further evidence such as clinical trials would be needed to confirm Ranolazine's direct therapeutic effect on coronary artery disorder."

The study mentioned investigates the effects of ranolazine on exercise tolerance in angina pectoris patients who were already being treated with either beta-blockers or diltiazem. The fact that such a study was conducted suggests that there is some existing evidence or hypothesis supporting ranolazine as a potential treatment for angina pectoris.

         However, it is important to note that while this statement provides some level of support for the claim, it does not constitute definitive proof that ranolazine treats angina pectoris. The study only investigates exercise tolerance in patients already receiving other treatments, not whether ranolazine can replace these treatments as a standalone therapy for angina pectoris. Further studies would be required to establish such a claim conclusively."

The statement indicates that Ranolazine has been shown to improve exercise-induced myocardial ischaemia, which is a form of myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, it mentions that Ranolazine lessens the severity of angina in chronic ischaemic heart disease, suggesting that it has a therapeutic effect on ischaemic conditions. However, it's important to note that while this suggests Ranolazine has beneficial effects in treating symptoms of myocardial ischemia, it does not necessarily confirm that it treats the underlying cause of myocardial ischemia. Therefore, while there is support for the claim, it is indirect and qualified by these considerations."

         The key term here is ""has shown promise in the treatment"". This implies that there have been studies or trials that suggest ranolazine can be effective in treating cardiovascular disease. However, it does not confirm that ranolazine definitively treats cardiovascular disorders as it uses the term ""promise"", which indicates potential but not yet proven efficacy. 

         Therefore, while not a direct confirmation, this statement does lend credence to the idea that ranolazine could be used as a treatment for cardiovascular disorders. It is important to note that further investigation would be required to fully substantiate this claim, such as reviewing the specific studies or trials that led to this conclusion."

This is because prednisolone is being used as a treatment for microscopic polyarteritis nodosa (MPN), which is closely related to MPA; both conditions fall under the umbrella of ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV).

        MPA is characterized by inflammation of small blood vessels (arterioles, capillaries, venules), while MPN affects small-to-medium-sized muscular arteries. Due to their similarities in clinical presentation, pathophysiology, and treatment response, they were previously considered one disease but have since been separated based on their distinct histopathological features.

        Given that prednisolone is used as a treatment for MPN, it is reasonable to infer that prednisolone may also be an effective treatment for MPA based on their shared features as AAVs. However, it is essential to note that direct evidence from clinical trials specifically investigating prednisolone"

The statement indicates that a trial of prednisolone was conducted on a patient with malignant ophthalmopathy due to Graves disease, but the improvement was unsatisfactory after 5-6 days of high-dose treatment. This suggests that prednisolone may not be an effective treatment for this specific eye disorder under these conditions. However, it does not rule out the possibility that prednisolone could be effective under different dosage levels, duration of treatment, or for other types of eye disorders. Further studies would be required to make definitive conclusions about the efficacy of prednisolone for treating various eye disorders."

The patient in question has exfoliative dermatitis and is being treated with both azathioprine and prednisolone. The fact that they were prescribed prednisolone suggests that it is considered an effective treatment for their condition. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation, and we cannot definitively say that prednisolone is responsible for improving the patient's condition without more information about their response to treatment. Additionally, the patient is receiving multiple treatments, which could confound any potential effects of prednisolone alone. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, it is indirect and not conclusive."

This suggests that prednisolone may be an effective treatment for ANCA-associated vasculitis, thus providing indirect support for the claim. However, it is important to note that this is based on a single case study, so further research involving larger sample sizes would be needed for more robust evidence of prednisolone's effectiveness in treating ANCA-associated vasculitis."

The study mentioned in the statement focuses on comparing the advantages of budesonide over prednisolone in treating autoimmune hepatitis. It does not provide evidence that prednisolone is an effective treatment for biliary atresia (BA). Furthermore, even though budesonide is being considered as an adjuvant BA treatment based on this study, it does not necessarily imply that prednisolone is ineffective for BA treatment; it only suggests that budesonide might be more advantageous in treating autoimmune hepatitis compared to prednisolone.

         In order for there to be indirect support for prednisolone treating biliary atresia from this statement, there would need to be some comparison of prednisolone against other treatments for biliary atresia specifically, or at least some evidence that prednisolone has beneficial effects on biliary atresia patients. However, in this statement, there is no direct link between prednisolone and biliary atresia treatment; thus, it does not provide indirect support for that claim."
23981131,Prednisolone treats mycosis fungoides,1094,Prednisolone was initially used alone as an alternative treatment for CEL.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats mycosis fungoides"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Prednisolone was initially used alone as an alternative treatment for CEL.""?","Yes, there is indirect support for the statement ""Prednisolone treats mycosis fungoides"" based on the provided information that ""Prednisolone was initially used alone as an alternative treatment for CEL.""

        The justification behind this decision lies in understanding that both mycosis fungoides (MF) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CEL) are types of lymphoma that affect the skin. Mycosis fungoides is actually considered to be the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (1). Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties (2). It is often used in treating various types of cancers including lymphomas due to its ability to suppress immune response (3).

        Although the original statement does not explicitly mention mycosis fungoides, it does state that prednisolone was used as an alternative treatment for CEL. Given that mycosis fungoides is a type of CEL, it is reasonable to infer that since prednisolone was used in treating one"

The study mentioned assesses the effects of prednisolone in treating trichinellosis in mice, implying that prednisolone has antiparasitic and/or anti-inflammatory effects that can be beneficial in treating trichinellosis. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy in humans, as further studies would be required to establish its clinical relevance and safety in human patients."

The statement mentions that a patient with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was treated with prednisolone and cyclosporine A, but it does not provide information about the outcome of the treatment specifically for interstitial lung disease 2. Furthermore, it discusses cyclosporine A and pirfenidone treatments in addition to prednisolone, making it difficult to isolate the effect of prednisolone on interstitial lung disease 2. Therefore, no definitive conclusions can be drawn about prednisolone's effectiveness in treating interstitial lung disease 2 based on this statement alone."
22500116,Prednisolone treats HIV infectious disease,1097,"The most common coexisting conditions were HIV infection (30%), prednisolone therapy (16.9%), and diabetes mellitus (15.7%).",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats HIV infectious disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The most common coexisting conditions were HIV infection (30%), prednisolone therapy (16.9%), and diabetes mellitus (15.7%).""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone treats HIV infectious disease."" The provided statement only indicates that HIV infection (30%) and prednisolone therapy (16.9%) were among the most common coexisting conditions in a given population but it does not imply that prednisolone has any therapeutic effect on HIV infection. In fact, it is crucial to consider that prednisolone is an immunosuppressive drug often used to manage inflammatory and autoimmune disorders; thus, its widespread use in coexistence with HIV infection might be due to various comorbidities associated with HIV rather than any direct antiviral activity against HIV itself."
22130331,Prednisolone treats schizophrenia,1098,"Therefore, the effect of prednisolone can be studied as a proof of concept for immune modulation as a treatment for schizophrenia.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats schizophrenia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Therefore, the effect of prednisolone can be studied as a proof of concept for immune modulation as a treatment for schizophrenia.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone treats schizophrenia."" The statement suggests that prednisolone can be used as a model for studying immune modulation as a potential treatment for schizophrenia. This implies that prednisolone may help us understand the immune system's role in schizophrenia, but it does not necessarily mean that prednisolone itself is an effective treatment for schizophrenia. To establish such a claim, controlled clinical trials would be required to demonstrate both safety and efficacy in treating schizophrenia patients with prednisolone."
21634207,Prednisolone treats chronic primary adrenal insufficiency,1099,The patient started insulin therapy and treatment for AD with prednisolone and fludrocortisone with good clinical response.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats chronic primary adrenal insufficiency"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The patient started insulin therapy and treatment for AD with prednisolone and fludrocortisone with good clinical response.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone treats chronic primary adrenal insufficiency"". The patient's good clinical response after starting treatment with prednisolone suggests that it may have contributed positively to managing adrenal insufficiency (AI). However, it is important to note that prednisolone is not used alone in treating AI; as seen in the statement, it is often used in combination with other medications like insulin therapy and fludrocortisone. Therefore, while prednisolone does seem to play a role in treating chronic primary adrenal insufficiency, it is likely as part of a broader treatment regimen rather than as a standalone treatment."

The study mentioned in the statement is investigating the effect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and azathioprine (AZA) on lung function and prednisolone dose in chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (cHP) patients. Although prednisolone is mentioned in the statement as part of the treatment regimen for these patients, it does not imply that prednisolone treats hypersensitivity pneumonitis since prednisolone is already being used in these patients as part of their existing treatment plan. The statement does not provide any information about prednisolone's effectiveness in treating hypersensitivity pneumonitis specifically."
20836940,Prednisolone treats juvenile idiopathic arthritis,1101,"Here, we report the case of an 8-year-old girl with a 5-year history of multiple subcutaneous nodules on her extremities and a right wrist joint contracture who had been previously diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and treated with salazosulfapyridine, low-dose prednisolone (PSL) and methotrexate.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats juvenile idiopathic arthritis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Here, we report the case of an 8-year-old girl with a 5-year history of multiple subcutaneous nodules on her extremities and a right wrist joint contracture who had been previously diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and treated with salazosulfapyridine, low-dose prednisolone (PSL) and methotrexate.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the claim that prednisolone treats juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The case report mentions that an 8-year-old girl diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis was treated with low-dose prednisolone (PSL) in addition to other medications (salazosulfapyridine and methotrexate). The fact that prednisolone was used as part of her treatment regimen suggests that it is considered an appropriate medication for juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect form of evidence since it does not explicitly demonstrate that prednisolone is responsible for any improvements in her condition. To establish a more direct link between prednisolone treatment and improvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis symptoms, additional information such as before-and-after treatment comparisons of symptom severity would be required."
20612701,Prednisolone treats myocarditis,1102,This is a case of EGPA relapse presenting as myocarditis despite treatment with prednisolone.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats myocarditis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""This is a case of EGPA relapse presenting as myocarditis despite treatment with prednisolone.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement provided. The case description mentions that despite treatment of Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) relapse using Prednisolone, myocarditis still occurred. This implies that although Prednisolone did not prevent myocarditis in this particular case, it does not negate its potential therapeutic effect in treating myocarditis in other contexts.

        However, it is important to note that EGPA itself is associated with myocarditis as part of its disease manifestation. Therefore, it is possible that Prednisolone may have been less effective in treating myocarditis in EGPA specifically compared to other forms of myocarditis unrelated to EGPA.

        To establish more direct support for Prednisolone as an effective treatment for myocarditis, further evidence from clinical trials or studies specifically investigating its efficacy in treating myocarditis would be required."

In fact, it suggests the opposite - that prednisolone therapy may lead to cataract development (as indicated by ""despite development of a cataract from prednisolone therapy""). The patient's stable visual acuity could be attributed to other factors such as proper cataract management (e.g., surgery) rather than prednisolone itself treating cataracts."

The statement suggests that prednisolone was used in combination with sitagliptin in men at high risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to protect against glucocorticoid (GC)-induced diabetogenic effects. This implies that prednisolone did not exacerbate diabetes in these individuals, and may even have had a protective effect in combination with sitagliptin. However, it does not provide direct evidence that prednisolone alone treats T2DM. Further studies would be needed to establish whether prednisolone has therapeutic benefits in T2DM when used without other medications."

In fact, it suggests quite the opposite. The phrase ""evidence to support treatment...is scant"" implies that there is limited scientific backing for using prednisolone as a treatment for croup. Therefore, it does not support the claim that prednisolone effectively treats croup."

The statement mentions an intensive protocol ACEP (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and prednisolone) used in treating peripheral T cell lymphoma (a subtype of mature T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma) along with ifosfamide. The fact that an important response and overall survival rates were observed implies that prednisolone might have contributed positively towards treating mature T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma as part of the ACEP protocol. However, it is essential to acknowledge that prednisolone is not acting alone in this context; it is one component of a multi-drug regimen. Therefore, any effect observed could be due to synergy between drugs in the protocol rather than prednisolone alone.

The statement indicates that treatment involving prednisolone was initiated when herpes zoster ophthalmicus was suspected, and it further notes that there was a gradual improvement in the clinical condition following treatment. This suggests that prednisolone may have contributed to the improvement of the condition, providing some level of indirect support for its effectiveness in treating herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

         However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. The improvement in clinical condition may be due solely to the administration of i.v. acyclovir, which is also used in treating herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The statement does not provide direct evidence of prednisolone's effectiveness in treating herpes zoster ophthalmicus as it does not explicitly state that prednisolone was responsible for the improvement in clinical condition.

The statement suggests that prednisolone can influence lipolysis in both lipomas and subcutaneous fat. While it doesn't explicitly say that prednisolone treats lipoma, increased lipolysis could potentially be beneficial in reducing the size of lipomas, which is a key aspect of treating them. However, this is an indirect inference and would need further investigation to confirm. It's also important to consider that treating a condition involves more than just manipulating one biological process; safety, efficacy, dosage, and potential side effects all need to be taken into account. Therefore, while this statement suggests a potential mechanism by which prednisolone might affect lipomas, it doesn't definitively prove that prednisolone is an effective treatment for lipoma."

The improvement of pericarditis symptoms in response to prednisolone treatment suggests that prednisolone has therapeutic efficacy for pericarditis. However, it is important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, so further evidence would be needed for definitive proof of prednisolone as an effective treatment for pericarditis.

         The statement also mentions that ""treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin improved the sensory nerve disturbance,"" which suggests that intravenous immunoglobulin may be an effective treatment for sensory nerve disturbances but does not provide any direct evidence regarding prednisolone's effect on pericarditis specifically.

         Nonetheless, given that pericarditis is often associated with inflammation, prednisolone's status as an anti-inflammatory drug supports its potential therapeutic utility for pericarditis treatment. However, it is crucial to consider potential side effects"

The statement describes an experiment where airway macrophage median percentage of red-hued area in stained sputum cytospin preparations was assessed in three groups of subjects: those with mild-to-severe asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, and healthy control subjects; those with eosinophilic severe asthma after treatment with prednisolone; and those with noneosinophilic asthma before corticosteroid withdrawal.

        
        The key point here is that prednisolone was administered to subjects with eosinophilic severe asthma (a condition characterized by an increased number of eosinophils in the lung). The fact that these subjects were included in the study suggests that prednisolone is being used as a treatment for eosinophilic severe asthma, which is a form of pulmonary eosinophilia. Therefore, if prednisolone"

The patient in question was being treated for aplastic anemia using prednisolone as part of their therapeutic regimen. The fact that they were receiving prednisolone suggests that it was considered an appropriate treatment for their condition by their medical team. However, it is important to note that this does not constitute direct evidence of prednisolone's efficacy in treating aplastic anemia, as other factors could influence patient outcomes. Additionally, the statement does not provide information about the patient's response to treatment or whether prednisolone was the sole or primary treatment for their aplastic anemia. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, it is indirect and should be interpreted within the context of the broader medical literature on aplastic anemia treatment."

The statement suggests that after prednisolone treatment in an HIV-negative patient, there was a coincidence of Kaposi sarcoma and psoriasis. This implies that prednisolone might have influenced the manifestation of psoriasis in this patient. However, it's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. This observation needs further investigation before any definitive conclusions can be drawn about prednisolone as a treatment for psoriasis. 

        The statement does not provide enough information about the patient's medical history, the dosage of prednisolone used, the duration of treatment, or how the psoriasis was assessed before and after treatment. Therefore, while there is some suggestive evidence, more rigorous studies would be needed to establish a causal relationship between prednisolone treatment and improvement in psoriasis symptoms. 

        Additionally, it's worth noting that prednisolone is a corticosteroid often used to reduce inflammation, and it has been used off-label for various dermatological"

The statement ""Prednisolone Trial: Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of prednisolone for women with idiopathic recurrent miscarriage and raised levels of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells in the endometrium"" does provide some level of indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone treats habitual spontaneous abortion"". This is because it suggests that prednisolone is being studied as a potential treatment for recurrent miscarriage in women who have raised levels of uterine natural killer cells in the endometrium. While it doesn't explicitly state that prednisolone treats habitual spontaneous abortion, it does imply that prednisolone could potentially have a positive effect on pregnancy outcomes in certain women, which could include those who have experienced habitual spontaneous abortion. However, it's important to note that this is based on a study protocol, not actual study results. Therefore, any conclusions about the effectiveness of prednisolone for treating habitual spontaneous abortion would be premature at this stage."

The case describes a patient with acquired relapsing TTP who was previously managed with plasmapheresis and prednisolone, indicating that prednisolone was part of the treatment regimen for this patient's TTP episodes. However, it's important to note that the patient also received plasmapheresis, making it impossible to determine whether prednisolone alone was responsible for the improvement. Additionally, the patient relapsed despite previous treatment with prednisolone, suggesting that it may not be consistently effective for all patients. Therefore, while there is some support for the statement, it is not direct or definitive evidence that prednisolone is an effective treatment for TTP on its own."

        The statement ""Three months later, AILD relapsed in spite of prednisolone treatment"" suggests that prednisolone was not effective in treating AILD (Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma) in this particular case. The word ""in spite"" indicates that despite the use of prednisolone, the disease still progressed. This is actually evidence against prednisolone being an effective treatment for AILD, not in support of it. 

        It is important to note that drug effectiveness can vary from person to person due to individual genetic factors, comorbidities, dosage, and other factors. Therefore, one case of treatment failure does not necessarily mean that prednisolone is ineffective for all patients with AILD. However, it does not provide support for the claim that prednisolone treats angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.

        The statement suggests that the addition of rituximab to a treatment regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP) can increase the median time to progression for advanced follicular lymphoma by 17 months. However, it does not specify that prednisolone has any therapeutic effect on follicular lymphoma when used outside of this combination therapy. Therefore, it is not possible to infer from this statement that prednisolone alone is an effective treatment for follicular lymphoma."

The statement mentions that FDG-PET was performed in rats bearing BCG granulomas or tumors before and after prednisolone treatment. FDG-PET is a type of imaging that is used in cancer diagnosis and treatment monitoring because it can show areas of increased metabolic activity, such as tumors. The fact that prednisolone treatment is being studied in relation to these FDG-PET scans suggests that there is an interest in understanding its effect on these tumors. However, it's important to note that this does not confirm that prednisolone treats neoplasm, but rather it indicates that there is ongoing research in this area."

Prednisolone is an anti-inflammatory medication often used in treating inflammatory conditions associated with pneumonia. The statement shows that prednisolone was administered after pneumonia recovery but does not explicitly mention its purpose; however, given its common use for treating inflammation related to pneumonia, it can be inferred that it might have played a part in managing pneumonia-related complications in this case. It is important to note that further investigation would be required for more definitive conclusions about prednisolone's specific effects on pneumonia treatment in general or in similar cases."
12190701,Prednisolone treats castration-resistant prostate carcinoma,1121,Fifteen patients 60 to 80 years old (a mean of 72 years) with hormone-refractory prostate cancer were treated with low dose prednisolone.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats castration-resistant prostate carcinoma"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Fifteen patients 60 to 80 years old (a mean of 72 years) with hormone-refractory prostate cancer were treated with low dose prednisolone.""?","Yes, indirectly. The statement provides evidence that prednisolone was used in treating patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer, which is a form of castration-resistant prostate carcinoma. However, it does not explicitly state that prednisolone treats castration-resistant prostate carcinoma. The strength of the support depends on other factors such as the clinical outcomes of the treatment and whether there were any controls in the study. It is also important to note that hormone-refractory prostate cancer is not always equivalent to castration-resistant prostate carcinoma, although they often overlap. Therefore, while the statement does provide some level of support for the claim, it is not definitive proof."

The claim that CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone) has been the standard chemotherapy regimen for diffuse large B-cell lymphomas for over 30 years suggests that each component of the CHOP regimen, including prednisolone, contributes to its efficacy in treating this type of lymphoma. However, it is important to note that prednisolone is not acting alone in treating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the context of CHOP therapy; it is part of a combination regimen that includes other drugs as well. Therefore, while there is indirect support for prednisolone's use in treating diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as part of CHOP therapy, it would be inaccurate to claim that prednisolone alone treats diffuse large B-cell lymphoma based on this information alone."

The statement describes six patients with KD who were treated with prednisolone after initial treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was unsuccessful. The use of prednisolone in an attempt to treat KD suggests that it was considered a viable treatment option for the disease, providing indirect support for the efficacy of prednisolone in treating KD. However, it is important to note that this is not direct evidence of prednisolone's effectiveness in treating KD, as it does not include information on the patients' outcomes after prednisolone treatment."

The text indicates that 56% of patients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and nephrotic range proteinuria were treated with prednisolone. However, it does not explicitly state that prednisolone treats FSGS. 

         The indirect support comes from the fact that prednisolone was used as a treatment in more than half of the patients with FSGS, suggesting that it is considered a viable treatment option for this condition. Furthermore, additional immunosuppression was used in 59% of those treated with prednisolone, which may suggest that prednisolone alone was not always sufficient in managing FSGS, but it was still part of the treatment regimen for these patients. 

         However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While prednisolone may be used in treating FSGS, it does not necessarily mean that prednisolone treats FSGS. Further studies would be needed to establish a direct causal relationship between prednisolone treatment and improvement in FSGS symptoms."

The study involves children diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) who were treated with prednisolone (PR). The fact that growth parameters were studied during their treatment period suggests that there might have been some effect of prednisolone on their condition. However, it is important to note that this statement does not provide direct evidence of prednisolone treating CAH; it only implies a possible association between PR use and growth parameters in CAH patients. Further investigation would be required to establish causality and determine the specific therapeutic effects of prednisolone on CAH symptoms."
11808057,Prednisolone treats keratitis,1126,Ciprofloxacin and prednisolone therapy for experimental Pseudomonas keratitis.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats keratitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Ciprofloxacin and prednisolone therapy for experimental Pseudomonas keratitis.""?","Yes, the statement ""Ciprofloxacin and prednisolone therapy for experimental Pseudomonas keratitis"" does lend indirect support to the claim that prednisolone treats keratitis. This is because prednisolone is mentioned in conjunction with ciprofloxacin as part of a therapy for treating experimental Pseudomonas keratitis.

        Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea that can be caused by bacterial infections like Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Experimental Pseudomonas keratitis in this case). The statement suggests that both ciprofloxacin (an antibiotic) and prednisolone (a corticosteroid) were used in treating this condition. Prednisolone is often prescribed in cases of keratitis due to its anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce inflammation in the cornea.

        However, it is important to note that prednisolone should be used cautiously in treating bacterial keratitis as it can suppress the immune response and potentially worsen the infection if used alone without an antibiotic"

        Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid steroid hormone used in various treatments including atopic dermatitis due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Prednicarbate is created by modifying Prednisolone through esterification at both 16α and 21 positions, which enhances its lipophilicity and prolongs its duration of action when compared to Prednisolone.

        The fact that Prednicarbate is used for treating atopic dermatitis implies that its parent molecule Prednisolone shares similar therapeutic properties for treating inflammatory skin conditions like atopic dermatitis. Therefore, there is an indirect relationship between Prednisolone treating atopic dermatitis based on Prednicarbate's use in such treatments.

The study mentioned is investigating a modified dose schedule of mitoxantrone in combination with prednisolone for treating patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer. The focus of the study is on mitoxantrone-prednisolone combination therapy rather than prednisolone alone as a treatment for prostate cancer.

         To provide indirect support for prednisolone as an effective treatment for prostate cancer, one would need evidence showing that prednisolone alone has beneficial effects on prostate cancer patients in either preclinical studies (e.g., in vitro experiments, animal models) or clinical trials specifically designed to test its efficacy as a single agent for treating prostate cancer.

         It is important to note that combining prednisolone with other therapeutic agents can have synergistic effects that enhance overall treatment efficacy without necessarily implying that prednisolone alone is an effective treatment for prostate cancer."

The text explicitly mentions prednisolone being used in combination with other drugs for treating erythema multiforme and aphthous ulcers of the mouth, which includes canker sores as they are also classified as a type of aphthous ulcer. However, it is important to note that the claim specifically mentions prednisolone treating canker sores without any mention of other drugs being used in combination, while the supporting statement mentions its use in combination with other drugs for treatment. Therefore, while there is indirect support for prednisolone being used in treatment of canker sores, further evidence would be needed to confirm its effectiveness when used alone for treating canker sores specifically."

This is because the statement suggests that prednisolone has been used in therapy for eczemas in both young and older infants, which implies that it may have some effect on treating eczema. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect support. A more direct support would require specific details about the effectiveness of prednisolone in treating atopic eczema."
10671990,Prednisolone treats Headache,1136,"We report a patient with neuro-Behcet's syndrome presenting with headache and personality change in whom CT and MRI brain imaging was normal, but regional cerebral blood flow imaging using single photon emission tomography with the tracer HMPAO showed extensive perfusion deficits which partially reversed after 3 months of prednisolone therapy.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats Headache"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""We report a patient with neuro-Behcet's syndrome presenting with headache and personality change in whom CT and MRI brain imaging was normal, but regional cerebral blood flow imaging using single photon emission tomography with the tracer HMPAO showed extensive perfusion deficits which partially reversed after 3 months of prednisolone therapy.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement for the phrase ""Prednisolone treats Headache"". The statement describes a patient with neuro-Behcet's syndrome who presented with headache among other symptoms. The patient was treated with prednisolone for 3 months, during which time there was a partial reversal of perfusion deficits in certain regions of the brain as shown by single photon emission tomography (SPECT) imaging.

         Although headache is not explicitly mentioned as having improved in this case report, it is one of the symptoms associated with neuro-Behcet's syndrome. Improvement in perfusion deficits in brain regions could potentially lead to alleviation of symptoms such as headache given their association in neuro-Behcet's syndrome. However, it is important to note that direct causality cannot be definitively concluded based on this single case report alone due to inherent limitations in generalizing from individual cases and lack of control group for comparison."
10574410,Prednisolone treats synovitis,1137,Prednisolone (meticortelone) in treatment of epicondylitis; radiohumeral bursitis and radiohumeral synovitis.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats synovitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Prednisolone (meticortelone) in treatment of epicondylitis; radiohumeral bursitis and radiohumeral synovitis.""?","Yes, the phrase ""Prednisolone treats synovitis"" does receive indirect support from the statement ""Prednisolone (meticortelone) in treatment of epicondylitis; radiohumeral bursitis and radiohumeral synovitis."" This is because synovitis is explicitly mentioned as one of the conditions treated by prednisolone in the provided statement.

        To elaborate, synovitis is inflammation of the synovial membrane, which lines joint capsules. Epicondylitis is an inflammation of the tendons that attach muscle to bone at the elbow (epicondyle), radiohumeral bursitis is inflammation of the bursa at the elbow (between the radius bone and humerus bone), and radiohumeral synovitis is inflammation of the synovial membrane at the elbow (between the radius bone and humerus bone). 

        Therefore, since prednisolone is listed as a treatment for radiohumeral synovitis in the statement, it indirectly supports the claim that prednisolone can be used to treat synovitis. However, it is important to note that this"

         The justification for this decision is as follows:

         1) The statement explicitly mentions prednisolone in conjunction with epicondylitis, which is one of the conditions listed. This direct association suggests that prednisolone has been considered for treating epicondylitis in some capacity.

         2) Prednisolone is a type of corticosteroid known for its anti-inflammatory properties. Epicondylitis is an inflammatory condition affecting tendons around the elbow joint. Therefore, it is plausible that prednisolone could be used in its treatment due to its potential for reducing inflammation in that area.

         3) Although meticortelone is also mentioned in the statement, it is not explicitly linked to epicondylitis like prednisolone is. Meticortelone is another type of corticosteroid but is not as commonly used"

The statement mentions that intra-articular injections of hydrocortisone prednisolone have been used in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid medication that is used primarily for its anti-inflammatory effect in various conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. While it may not be a primary treatment for osteoarthritis due to its different pathophysiology compared to rheumatoid arthritis, prednisolone can still provide symptomatic relief in osteoarthritis by reducing inflammation in the affected joints. However, it is important to note that long-term use of prednisolone is associated with significant side effects, so its use should be carefully monitored and tailored to individual patient needs."

The statement ""On the development of peptic ulcers in patients treated with prednisone or prednisolone"" discusses the occurrence of peptic ulcers in patients undergoing treatment with these medications but does not imply that prednisolone is used as a treatment for peptic ulcer disease. In fact, both prednisone and prednisolone belong to a class of drugs called corticosteroids that can increase the risk of gastrointestinal side effects such as peptic ulcers due to their effect on reducing gastric mucosal protection and increasing gastric acid secretion (Gisbert et al., 2009). Therefore, it is important not to confuse an association between drug use and an adverse outcome as evidence for using that drug as a treatment for that condition.

The statement mentions that prednisolone is used in treating non-tropical sprue (which is another term for celiac disease) but it does not indicate that prednisolone is responsible for treating celiac disease itself. Instead, it points out that prednisolone corrects plain-water deficit and extracellular fluid volume loss in patients with non-tropical sprue (celiac disease). Therefore, it does not establish prednisolone as a direct treatment for celiac disease but rather as a potential therapy for managing some of its symptoms."

The text mentions prednisolone as one of the management options for hemangioma, which suggests its use in treating this condition. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation; therefore, while prednisolone may be used in treating hemangioma, further evidence would be needed to definitively conclude that prednisolone treats hemangioma."
9668241,Prednisolone treats pure red-cell aplasia,1149,The PRCA and AIHA were successfully treated with prednisolone.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats pure red-cell aplasia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The PRCA and AIHA were successfully treated with prednisolone.""?","Yes, the statement ""The PRCA and AIHA were successfully treated with prednisolone"" does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone treats pure red-cell aplasia (PRCA)"". AIHA stands for Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia, which is a different condition than PRCA but both fall under the broader category of hematologic disorders. The successful treatment of these conditions with prednisolone suggests that prednisolone has therapeutic efficacy in treating certain types of hematologic disorders. However, it is important to note that this does not directly confirm that prednisolone treats PRCA specifically as PRCA was not treated in isolation in this case. Further studies focusing on PRCA would be needed for more direct support."

The patient was diagnosed with Graves' disease and initially treated with propylthiouracil, which is a common first-line therapy for controlling hyperthyroidism associated with Graves' disease. Additionally, prednisolone was administered for neck pain, indicating that prednisolone was used concurrently during the management of Graves' disease. Prednisolone is an anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid that can help alleviate symptoms such as neck pain and swelling caused by Graves' disease. Therefore, although it does not explicitly state that prednisolone treats Graves' disease, it does suggest that prednisolone can be used as an adjunct treatment for managing symptoms associated with Graves' disease."

The statement ""Methotrexate and prednisolone treatment of a child with psoriatic arthritis"" implies that both Methotrexate and Prednisolone were used in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis in a patient. Therefore, it suggests that Prednisolone is an agent that can be used in treating psoriatic arthritis, even though it does not explicitly state that Prednisolone treats psoriatic arthritis on its own. However, it is important to note that this does not constitute direct evidence for the efficacy of Prednisolone in treating psoriatic arthritis as it could be that Prednisolone was used as an adjunct therapy in combination with Methotrexate, which is a more commonly used medication for psoriatic arthritis. Further evidence from clinical trials would be needed to definitively establish that Prednisolone is an effective treatment for psoriatic arthritis."

The statement mentions that dogs with multicentric lymphosarcoma were treated with a standard chemotherapy protocol that includes prednisolone as one of its components. This implies that prednisolone is being used as part of a treatment regimen for lymphoma in dogs, thus providing indirect support for its use in treating lymphoma. However, it is important to note that prednisolone is not acting alone in treating lymphoma in this context; it is part of a larger chemotherapy protocol that includes other drugs as well (vincristine and cyclophosphamide). Therefore, one cannot conclude from this statement alone that prednisolone is solely responsible for treating lymphoma in dogs."

         The statement implies that prednisolone was administered as a treatment for dermatomyositis and that it led to an improvement in the condition. This suggests that prednisolone has therapeutic effects on dermatomyositis, which aligns with the general meaning of ""Prednisolone treats dermatomyositis"". However, it is important to note that while this evidence supports the claim, it does not prove it definitively. Further studies would be needed to establish a direct causal relationship between prednisolone use and improvement in dermatomyositis."

The statement provided mentions that three patients with ocular pemphigoid (CP) were treated with mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone. This implies that prednisolone was used as part of the treatment regimen for ocular pemphigoid, thus providing indirect support for the claim. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation, so while prednisolone was used in treatment of ocular pemphigoid in these cases, it does not definitively prove that prednisolone is solely responsible for treating ocular pemphigoid."

The patient was diagnosed with membranous nephropathy and was treated with prednisolone, suggesting that prednisolone was used as a therapeutic agent for this specific type of glomerulonephritis. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation, so while it appears that prednisolone was used to treat membranous nephropathy in this case, it does not definitively prove that prednisolone is an effective treatment for membranous glomerulonephritis in general. Further studies would be required to establish such causality and determine the efficacy of prednisolone as a standard treatment for membranous glomerulonephritis."

This is because Prednisolone (PSL) is a type of corticosteroid often used in the treatment of subacute thyroiditis (SAT). The conclusion suggests that treatment of SAT with PSL results in a recurrence rate of approximately 20%. This implies that PSL has some efficacy in treating SAT, thus providing indirect support for the claim that Prednisolone treats subacute thyroiditis. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof and further evidence would be needed for a more robust conclusion."
8819323,Prednisolone treats meningeal tuberculosis,1160,"In this case, prednisolone was indispensable for treating tuberculous meningitis in combination with appropriate antituberculosis drugs, though the role of corticosteroids has remained controversial over the years.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats meningeal tuberculosis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""In this case, prednisolone was indispensable for treating tuberculous meningitis in combination with appropriate antituberculosis drugs, though the role of corticosteroids has remained controversial over the years.""?","Yes, the phrase ""Prednisolone treats meningeal tuberculosis"" does receive indirect support from the statement provided. The statement indicates that prednisolone was used in combination with appropriate antituberculosis drugs to treat tuberculous meningitis (a form of meningeal tuberculosis). The word ""indispensable"" suggests that prednisolone played a crucial role in the treatment process. However, it is important to note that the statement also mentions that the role of corticosteroids (which include prednisolone) in treating tuberculous meningitis has been controversial over the years. This implies that while prednisolone may be beneficial in some cases, its use is not universally accepted as standard treatment for meningeal tuberculosis due to potential side effects or lack of sufficient evidence in certain contexts. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, it is not unequivocal and should be considered in light of ongoing debates in the field."
8755027,Prednisolone treats hypereosinophilic syndrome,1161,"Prednisolone (PSL) was administered, which improved the anemia, eosinophilia and the cavities.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats hypereosinophilic syndrome"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Prednisolone (PSL) was administered, which improved the anemia, eosinophilia and the cavities.""?","Yes, the statement ""Prednisolone (PSL) was administered, which improved the anemia, eosinophilia and the cavities"" does provide indirect support for the claim that ""Prednisolone treats hypereosinophilic syndrome"". This is because hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) is characterized by high levels of eosinophils in the blood (eosinophilia) that can lead to organ damage, including anemia and cavity formation in various tissues. By demonstrating that PSL treatment led to improvements in anemia, eosinophilia, and cavities in a patient, it suggests that PSL may have been effective in treating HES in this particular case.

         However, it is important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, so further investigation would be required to definitively conclude that PSL was solely responsible for these improvements. Additionally, HES is a complex condition that can have various underlying causes; therefore, it is possible that PSL may not be an effective treatment for all cases of HES. Nonetheless, based on the information provided, there is some indirect evidence supporting the claim that Prednisolone"

The background statement mentions that both ACTH and prednisolone have been established for managing infantile spasms, which is another term for West syndrome. However, the background statement also highlights significant morbidity associated with their use, suggesting that they may not be suitable for long-term treatment due to potential adverse effects. Therefore, while prednisolone is supported as a treatment for West syndrome, it is not without its drawbacks."

In fact, it suggests quite the opposite. The statement indicates that despite being on prednisolone treatment, the individual still succumbed to lung tuberculosis and acute tuberculous pericarditis. This implies that prednisolone was not effective in treating these conditions in this particular case.

        Prednisolone is a corticosteroid often used in treating inflammatory conditions as it can suppress the immune system. It is sometimes used in conjunction with other medications for tuberculosis to manage severe symptoms or complications such as inflammation of lung tissue (pleurisy) or allergic reactions to anti-TB drugs. However, it is not typically used as a primary treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis due to its potential to suppress the immune system, which could make it more difficult for the body to fight off the infection.

        Therefore, based on the information given, there is no indirect support for the claim that prednisolone treats pulmonary tuberculosis; rather, it suggests that prednisolone did"

The study measures urinary nitric oxide (NO) metabolite levels in reactional leprosy patients before and after high-dose prednisolone treatment. The significant decrease in NO metabolite levels after prednisolone treatment suggests that prednisolone has an impact on the immune response in leprosy patients, which could be interpreted as evidence of its efficacy in treating leprosy. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect measure of treatment efficacy; direct evidence would require clinical assessments of disease progression or resolution following prednisolone treatment.

         The study does not explicitly state that prednisolone treats leprosy; rather it shows an association between prednisolone treatment and decreased NO metabolite levels in reactional leprosy patients. This is still valuable evidence as it supports further investigation into prednisolone as a potential treatment for leprosy. However,"

The Discriminant Function (DF) is a scoring system used in alcoholic hepatitis that helps predict mortality based on factors such as bilirubin levels and prothrombin time. A high DF indicates severe disease. Spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy (SHE) is another severe complication of alcoholic hepatitis. Therefore, patients who have either of these conditions likely have severe alcoholic hepatitis. The study suggests that Prednisolone improves survival in these severe cases, which implies that it has a therapeutic effect on alcoholic hepatitis. However, it's important to note that this does not necessarily mean Prednisolone is effective for all cases of alcoholic hepatitis, especially those that are less severe."

However, it's important to note that prednisolone is used in combination with other drugs in this study, so it doesn't directly prove that prednisolone alone treats lupus nephritis. The effectiveness could be due to the combination of drugs, not prednisolone specifically. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, it is not definitive proof that prednisolone alone treats lupus nephritis."

The statement suggests that prednisolone has an effect on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when used in combination with beclomethasone dipropionate. This implies that prednisolone has some therapeutic value in treating COPD, even though it may not be as effective on its own as when used in combination with other treatments. However, it's important to note that the claim does not specify whether prednisolone is effective in treating chronic COPD specifically, which is a more acute form of the disease. Therefore, while there is some indirect support, more specific research would be needed to fully substantiate the claim that prednisolone treats chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

The fact that three out of eight patients with thrombocytopenia were treated with prednisolone according to a protocol for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura suggests that prednisolone is being used as a treatment for thrombocytopenia in this context. However, it does not directly prove that prednisolone treats thrombocytopenia because it does not provide information about the outcomes of the treatment or whether other treatments were also used. It simply indicates that prednisolone is one of the treatments being used for thrombocytopenia in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura."

The claim ""A regimen which incorporates cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (CHOP) is the standard treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)"" implies that prednisolone is part of a treatment regimen that is effective for some patients with NHL. However, the statement also mentions that it has not been effective in patients with aggressive NHL who are at high risk. This does not negate the fact that prednisolone is still part of an effective treatment regimen for some patients with NHL. Therefore, while the statement does not directly support the claim that prednisolone treats non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it does provide indirect support by indicating that prednisolone is a component of an effective treatment regimen for some patients with NHL."

The study mentioned in the statement investigates the relationship between various factors including age, sex, disease duration, and cumulative prednisolone dose on femur T score in CD patients. Although it shows an inverse relationship between disease duration and femur T score in CD patients, it does not provide evidence that prednisolone is responsible for treating Crohn disease. The study design does not allow for causal inferences about prednisolone's therapeutic effect on Crohn disease.

        To establish whether prednisolone treats Crohn disease, well-designed clinical trials would be required where patients receiving prednisolone show improvement in disease symptoms compared to those not receiving prednisolone treatment while controlling for other factors that may influence disease progression. The statement provided only investigates an association between cumulative prednisolone dose and bone density in CD patients but does not provide evidence for prednisolone as an effective treatment for Crohn disease itself."

The statement describes a treatment regimen for acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) in adults using the DMCP protocol, which includes prednisolone among other drugs. However, it specifically mentions ANLL, not ALL. These two types of leukemia have different characteristics and require different treatment approaches. Therefore, the effectiveness of prednisolone in treating ANLL cannot be extrapolated to support its effectiveness in treating ALL."

The statement indicates that two patients diagnosed with Wegener's granulomatosis were treated with prednisolone continuously for 3 and 5 years, respectively. The fact that these patients were treated for an extended period suggests that prednisolone may have been effective in managing their condition, thus providing indirect evidence for its use in treating GPA.

         However, it is important to note that this evidence is indirect and does not definitively prove that prednisolone is an effective treatment for GPA on its own. The statement does not provide information on whether chlorambucil or prednisolone was responsible for the observed therapeutic effect, nor does it specify if other treatments were used concurrently. To establish more robust evidence for prednisolone as an effective treatment for GPA, additional studies controlling for potential confounding factors would be required.

         In summary, while the statement does provide some level of support for prednisolone as a treatment for GPA"
7927983,Prednisolone treats nephrotic syndrome,1174,"The second patient, a 73-year-old man receiving prednisolone therapy for nephrotic syndrome, developed right leg cellulitis that evolved to NF.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats nephrotic syndrome"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The second patient, a 73-year-old man receiving prednisolone therapy for nephrotic syndrome, developed right leg cellulitis that evolved to NF.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the claim that prednisolone treats nephrotic syndrome. In fact, it suggests quite the opposite. The statement indicates that a patient who was already on prednisolone therapy for nephrotic syndrome developed cellulitis and subsequently necrotizing fasciitis (NF). This implies that prednisolone may not be effectively treating the nephrotic syndrome in this particular patient, as they still experienced complications related to their condition.

         Prednisolone is a type of corticosteroid often used in treating inflammatory diseases due to its anti-inflammatory properties. In nephrotic syndrome, prednisolone is used as an immunosuppressive agent to reduce proteinuria (the presence of excess protein in urine) by minimizing inflammation in the kidneys. However, long-term use of prednisolone can lead to various side effects such as infections (e.g., cellulitis) due to its immunosuppressive nature.

         Therefore, while prednisolone may help manage certain aspects of nephrotic syndrome, it does not necessarily imply that"

The study found that patients diagnosed with Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA), also known as temporal arteritis, had significantly higher levels of YKL-40 in their serum compared to healthy age-matched controls (P<0.01). Importantly, treatment of these patients with Prednisolone led to a significant decrease in YKL-40 levels after one month (-38%; P<0.001). This decrease in YKL-40 levels suggests that Prednisolone is effective in treating temporal arteritis since YKL-40 levels have been associated with disease activity in GCA patients. However, it is important to note that while this evidence supports Prednisolone as an effective treatment for temporal arteritis, it does not definitively prove that Prednisolone treats temporal arteritis as further studies would be required to establish causality conclusively."
7900659,Prednisolone treats polymyalgia rheumatica,1176,Most patients with PMR had normal serum YKL-40 levels (median 158 microg/liter) and had no changes in the serum YKL-40 levels during prednisolone treatment.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats polymyalgia rheumatica"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Most patients with PMR had normal serum YKL-40 levels (median 158 microg/liter) and had no changes in the serum YKL-40 levels during prednisolone treatment.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone treats polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR)"". The statement indicates that most patients with PMR have normal serum YKL-40 levels, both before and during prednisolone treatment. This suggests that changes in YKL-40 levels may not be a reliable indicator of PMR activity or treatment response. However, it does not provide evidence that prednisolone is not effective in treating PMR; it only indicates that YKL-40 may not be a useful biomarker for monitoring PMR treatment response. The effectiveness of prednisolone in treating PMR is typically evaluated through clinical symptoms and signs, not through YKL-40 levels."
7866839,Prednisolone treats acute myeloid leukemia,1177,"Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia of childhood with cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, prednisolone, and mercaptopurine or thioguanine.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats acute myeloid leukemia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia of childhood with cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, prednisolone, and mercaptopurine or thioguanine.""?","Yes, the phrase ""Prednisolone treats acute myeloid leukemia"" does receive indirect support from the statement provided. The statement indicates that prednisolone is used in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia of childhood in combination with other drugs such as cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, mercaptopurine or thioguanine. This suggests that prednisolone has some therapeutic effect on acute myeloid leukemia, thus providing indirect support for the claim. However, it is important to note that prednisolone is rarely used as a single agent in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia due to its lower efficacy compared to other drugs. It is usually used in combination therapies as part of a treatment regimen."
7819165,Prednisolone treats systemic lupus erythematosus,1178,Subacute severe steatohepatitis during prednisolone therapy for systemic lupus erythematosis.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats systemic lupus erythematosus"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Subacute severe steatohepatitis during prednisolone therapy for systemic lupus erythematosis.""?","Yes, there is indirect support for the claim that prednisolone treats systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) based on the statement provided. The statement mentions that subacute severe steatohepatitis occurred during prednisolone therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Prednisolone is a type of corticosteroid often used in treating autoimmune diseases like SLE due to its anti-inflammatory properties (1).

        
        The development of steatohepatitis during prednisolone therapy does not necessarily contradict its therapeutic effect on SLE; it could be an adverse effect of long-term corticosteroid use (2). Prolonged use of corticosteroids like prednisolone can lead to metabolic issues such as steatohepatitis (3). This potential side effect does not negate prednisolone's efficacy in managing SLE symptoms but highlights the importance of monitoring patients for side effects during treatment (4).

        
        In summary, while prednisolone may have adverse effects like steatohepatitis,"
7800931,Prednisolone treats autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura,1179,"However, after administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG) (0.4 g/kg/day x 5 days), low-dose PSL (20 mg/day) alleviated the LEMS and ITP, and the diseases have remained in remission for 8 months without additional IVIG.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""However, after administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG) (0.4 g/kg/day x 5 days), low-dose PSL (20 mg/day) alleviated the LEMS and ITP, and the diseases have remained in remission for 8 months without additional IVIG.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the claim that prednisolone (PSL) treats autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The statement indicates that after administration of immunoglobulin (IVIG) and low-dose PSL (20 mg/day), the ITP was alleviated and remained in remission for 8 months without additional IVIG treatment. This suggests that PSL had a therapeutic effect on ITP in this case. However, it is important to note that IVIG was also administered, so the effect cannot be solely attributed to PSL. Additionally, this is one case study, so while it provides some evidence, it does not conclusively prove that PSL treats ITP. Further studies would be needed to confirm this."
7704078,Prednisolone treats colitis,1180,"On the other hand, prednisolone and short chain fatty acids seemed to improve only the physiologic changes of colitis.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats colitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""On the other hand, prednisolone and short chain fatty acids seemed to improve only the physiologic changes of colitis.""?","Yes, the phrase ""Prednisolone treats colitis"" does receive indirect support from the statement ""On the other hand, prednisolone and short chain fatty acids seemed to improve only the physiologic changes of colitis."" This is because prednisolone is mentioned as having an effect on colitis, even though it specifically mentions improving only the physiologic changes. 

        However, it is important to note that ""treats"" is a strong word that typically implies a complete resolution of symptoms or disease state. The statement does not explicitly say that prednisolone resolves colitis, but rather that it improves some of its physiologic changes. Therefore, while there is some level of support for prednisolone having an effect on colitis, it may not be entirely accurate to say that it ""treats"" colitis based on this statement alone. Further evidence would be needed to make such a claim."
7676165,Prednisolone treats hypercalcemia disease,1181,"Treatment with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, transurethral lithotomy, saline infusion, and prednisolone (30 mg/day) alleviated the urolithiasis, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats hypercalcemia disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Treatment with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, transurethral lithotomy, saline infusion, and prednisolone (30 mg/day) alleviated the urolithiasis, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone treats hypercalcemia disease"". The reason is that in the provided statement, it mentions that treatment involving prednisolone (30 mg/day) was used in conjunction with other therapies to alleviate several conditions including hypercalcemia. This implies that prednisolone could have contributed to the improvement of hypercalcemia, thus offering support for its use in treating hypercalcemia. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect inference since multiple treatments were administered simultaneously, making it impossible to attribute the effect solely to prednisolone without further investigation."
7603475,Prednisolone treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy,1182,A special program for long-term application of low-dose prednisolone treatment in Duchenne-Becker muscular dystrophy with complex control of the patients' state was developed.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""A special program for long-term application of low-dose prednisolone treatment in Duchenne-Becker muscular dystrophy with complex control of the patients' state was developed.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement provided. The key phrase ""long-term application of low-dose prednisolone treatment in Duchenne-Becker muscular dystrophy"" suggests that prednisolone is being used as a therapeutic agent for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, it is important to note that this does not constitute direct evidence of prednisolone treating DMD as it does not explicitly state that prednisolone improves symptoms or halts disease progression.

        The statement mentions that the program is complex and involves controlling the patients' state, which could imply that prednisolone is used in conjunction with other interventions or treatments for DMD management. Therefore, while there is some level of support for prednisolone being used in DMD treatment, further investigation would be necessary to establish its efficacy as a standalone treatment for DMD.

        In summary, while indirect support can be inferred from the statement regarding prednisolone treating DMD, more rigorous studies would be required for definitive evidence of its therapeutic benefits for DMD patients."
7600829,Prednisolone treats multiple sclerosis,1183,"Long-term open-trial of mizoribine with prednisolone in 24 patients with multiple sclerosis: safety, clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcome.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats multiple sclerosis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Long-term open-trial of mizoribine with prednisolone in 24 patients with multiple sclerosis: safety, clinical and magnetic resonance imaging outcome.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement provided. The study mentions the use of prednisolone in combination with mizoribine for treating multiple sclerosis in 24 patients over the long term. Although it does not explicitly state that prednisolone alone treats multiple sclerosis, it suggests that prednisolone is part of an effective treatment regimen for managing multiple sclerosis symptoms when used in conjunction with mizoribine.

        However, it is essential to note that open-label trials have inherent limitations as they lack blinding and randomization, which can introduce bias in treatment outcomes. Therefore, while there is some evidence suggesting prednisolone may have beneficial effects in treating multiple sclerosis as part of a combination therapy, more rigorous clinical trials would be required for definitive conclusions regarding its efficacy as monotherapy for multiple sclerosis treatment."
7586864,Prednisolone treats ulcerative colitis,1184,A 25-year-old man had been treated with high-dose prednisolone for UC.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats ulcerative colitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""A 25-year-old man had been treated with high-dose prednisolone for UC.""?","Yes, the statement ""A 25-year-old man had been treated with high-dose prednisolone for UC"" does provide indirect support for the claim that prednisolone treats ulcerative colitis (UC). 

        The statement implies that prednisolone was used as a treatment for UC in this particular patient, suggesting that prednisolone has therapeutic value in managing UC symptoms. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect inference based on a single case report. A more robust evaluation of the efficacy of prednisolone in treating UC would require controlled clinical trials and systematic reviews of the literature. 

        Prednisolone is a corticosteroid that is often used in the treatment of UC due to its anti-inflammatory effects. It can help reduce inflammation in the lining of the intestine, thereby alleviating symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, and rectal bleeding. However, long-term use of prednisolone is associated with significant side effects, which is why it is typically used as a short-term treatment or in conjunction"
7485161,Prednisolone treats uveitis,1185,DISCUSSION: Allopurinol is more effective than prednisolone in treating EAU.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats uveitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""DISCUSSION: Allopurinol is more effective than prednisolone in treating EAU.""?","Yes, indirectly it does support the phrase ""Prednisolone treats uveitis"". The statement ""Allopurinol is more effective than prednisolone in treating EAU"" implies that prednisolone does have some effect on EAU (Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis), otherwise it wouldn't be compared to allopurinol. Uveitis is a form of EAU, so if prednisolone has an effect on EAU, it can be inferred that it also has an effect on uveitis. However, this is an indirect inference and should be confirmed through direct clinical studies or trials specifically investigating the effect of prednisolone on uveitis."
7430895,Prednisolone treats asthma,1186,"Interleukin-5 mRNA was detected in all asthmatics before prednisolone therapy; however, after prednisolone therapy, IL-5 mRNA was only detected in non-GCS-responsive BHR asthmatics.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats asthma"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Interleukin-5 mRNA was detected in all asthmatics before prednisolone therapy; however, after prednisolone therapy, IL-5 mRNA was only detected in non-GCS-responsive BHR asthmatics.""?","Yes, indirectly it does support the claim that prednisolone treats asthma. The statement suggests that prednisolone therapy reduces Interleukin-5 (IL-5) mRNA levels in most asthmatics but not in non-GCS-responsive BHR asthmatics. This implies that prednisolone has an effect on asthma pathophysiology, specifically by reducing IL-5 mRNA levels, which is associated with asthma severity and inflammation. Therefore, prednisolone could be considered as a treatment for asthma based on this evidence. However, it is important to note that not all asthmatics respond to prednisolone therapy, as seen in non-GCS-responsive BHR asthmatics, indicating that further studies are needed to understand the variability in responses among different asthma subtypes."
7417999,Prednisolone treats IgA glomerulonephritis,1187,"Combined therapy with prednisolone, azathioprine, heparin-warfarin, and dipyridamole for paediatric patients with severe IgA nephropathy--is it relevant for adult patients?",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone treats IgA glomerulonephritis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Combined therapy with prednisolone, azathioprine, heparin-warfarin, and dipyridamole for paediatric patients with severe IgA nephropathy--is it relevant for adult patients?""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone treats IgA glomerulonephritis."" The original statement discusses combined therapy for paediatric patients with severe IgA nephropathy (a type of glomerulonephritis), which includes prednisolone as one of several components. However, it does not specifically link prednisolone as an effective treatment for IgA glomerulonephritis in adults.

        To provide indirect support for ""Prednisolone treats IgA glomerulonephritis,"" one would need evidence showing that prednisolone alone (not in combination therapy) has beneficial effects on IgA glomerulonephritis in adults. The original statement does not provide such evidence; therefore, it cannot be used as indirect support for that claim.

        It is important to differentiate between combined therapy for severe cases of IgA nephropathy in paediatric patients and using prednisolone as monotherapy for treating IgA glomerulonephritis in adults since these two scenarios may have different outcomes due to differences in patient demograph"

The statement provides evidence that prednisolone was used in conjunction with methotrexate to treat a patient with renal amyloidosis caused by rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and it resulted in remission of the nephrotic syndrome. This suggests that prednisolone may have contributed positively to the treatment of RA-related symptoms in this case. However, it's important to note that prednisolone was used in combination with methotrexate, making it impossible to attribute the remission solely to prednisolone. Furthermore, remission of nephrotic syndrome is not equivalent to treating rheumatoid arthritis itself; it is one of many potential symptoms of RA that can be targeted by treatment. Therefore, while there is some indirect support for prednisolone treating RA from this statement, it is not definitive proof."

The aim of the study includes evaluating the efficacy of hydrocortisone in oral submucous fibrosis patients in relation to increasing mouth opening, reducing burning sensation, and improving mucosal lining. This suggests that hydrocortisone is being considered as a potential treatment for oral submucous fibrosis in this study, providing indirect evidence that it may have beneficial effects in treating this condition. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy; further investigation through rigorous clinical trials would be necessary to establish hydrocortisone as an effective treatment for oral submucous fibrosis."

         The statement in question specifically discusses the potential of cyanine dyes, particularly compounds 5a-f, in treating infections caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans). Hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid hormone used primarily for its anti-inflammatory effects and is not typically used as an antimicrobial agent. Therefore, there is no indirect support for hydrocortisone's efficacy in treating infections from the statement provided."

         The serum cortisol concentration in lymphoma patients indicates the level of cortisol, a stress hormone produced by the adrenal gland, in these patients. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol often used in medication for various conditions such as inflammation, allergies, and autoimmune disorders. 

         While it is true that hydrocortisone can be used in treating certain types of cancer due to its immunosuppressive properties, it does not automatically mean that it ""treats lymphoma."" Lymphoma is a complex disease that involves various types of cancers originating from lymphocytes (white blood cells). The treatment for lymphoma usually involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or stem cell transplantation - not just hydrocortisone alone.

19834754,Hydrocortisone treats cardiac arrest,1193,"Compared to controls, glycocalyx was mildly injured by CA, severely disrupted by hyaluronidase (HAase) with CA, and mitigated by hydrocortisone (HC) with CA.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone treats cardiac arrest"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Compared to controls, glycocalyx was mildly injured by CA, severely disrupted by hyaluronidase (HAase) with CA, and mitigated by hydrocortisone (HC) with CA.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement provided. The study compares cardiac arrest (CA) controls to those treated with hyaluronidase (HAase) during CA, as well as those treated with hydrocortisone (HC) during CA. The results indicate that glycocalyx was mildly injured by CA alone but severely disrupted by CA combined with HAase treatment. However, when HC is administered during CA, glycocalyx disruption is mitigated compared to CA plus HAase treatment.

        
        While the statement does not explicitly claim that hydrocortisone treats cardiac arrest, it does suggest that hydrocortisone may have a protective effect on glycocalyx during cardiac arrest events when compared to controls and HAase treatments. This protective effect could potentially contribute to improved patient outcomes during cardiac arrest events; however, further investigation is necessary to establish causality and clinical relevance conclusively."
17499762,Hydrocortisone treats dermatitis,1194,"In the acute phase of dermatitis, topical hydrocortisone treatment has both a local and a systemic effect, due to percutaneous absorption.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone treats dermatitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""In the acute phase of dermatitis, topical hydrocortisone treatment has both a local and a systemic effect, due to percutaneous absorption.""?","Yes, the statement ""In the acute phase of dermatitis, topical hydrocortisone treatment has both a local and a systemic effect, due to percutaneous absorption"" does provide indirect support for the claim that ""Hydrocortisone treats dermatitis"". 

         The statement suggests that hydrocortisone has both local (at the site of application) and systemic effects when used in the treatment of dermatitis. This implies that hydrocortisone can help manage symptoms of dermatitis (local effect) and potentially influence the body's overall response to dermatitis (systemic effect). This is consistent with the general understanding that hydrocortisone is often used as a treatment for various forms of dermatitis due to its anti-inflammatory properties. However, it is important to note that while this statement provides indirect support for the claim, it does not constitute direct evidence of hydrocortisone's effectiveness in treating dermatitis. For that, one would need to look at clinical trials or other forms of direct empirical evidence."

The statement discusses the effects of Prolonged-Lensed (PL) therapy on cortisol availability in chronically stressed men and its potential impact on stress-induced memory impairments. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol; however, there is no mention of hydrocortisone being used in treatment nor any direct link made between cortisol increase and dissociative amnesia treatment in the statement provided. Therefore, it does not offer indirect support for the claim that hydrocortisone treats dissociative amnesia."

        The statement discusses the effect of inhibitors on cortisol secretion in hypoxic dogs but does not explicitly mention hydrocortisone or its therapeutic effect on hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in the blood). Hydrocortisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone that acts as an anti-inflammatory agent; it is not an inhibitor of cortisol secretion.

        Hypoxemia is caused by various factors such as impaired lung function, reduced oxygen supply, or abnormal hemoglobin function. While hydrocortisone may help manage some underlying conditions that contribute to hypoxemia by reducing inflammation, it does not directly treat hypoxemia itself by increasing oxygen levels in the blood.

        Therefore, based on the provided statement, there is no evidence supporting the claim that hydrocortisone treats hypoxemia in dogs or any"

The statement suggests that cortisol (a hormone which hydrocortisone mimics) is commonly used in treating psoriasis and atopic dermatitis due to aberrant expression of StAR and MLN64, which implies dysregulation of epidermal steroid synthesis in these patients. This implies that correcting this dysregulation through administration of cortisol (or hydrocortisone) could potentially alleviate symptoms of psoriasis. However, it is important to note that while corticosteroids like hydrocortisone have been used in treating psoriasis, they may not be effective for all patients due to potential side effects and development of resistance over time. Therefore, further investigation is necessary for more direct support of hydrocortisone as an effective treatment for psoriasis."

The statement mentions that ME-609 (Xerese, Xerclear) is a topical treatment for HSL that contains 1% hydrocortisone along with 5% acyclovir. This implies that hydrocortisone is an active ingredient in a treatment for herpes labialis, thus lending indirect support to the claim that hydrocortisone can be used to treat HL.

        However, it is important to note that hydrocortisone itself is not primarily an antiviral agent; instead, its role in ME-609 is likely to help manage inflammation and symptoms associated with herpes labialis rather than treating the viral infection itself. Acyclovir is the primary antiviral agent in ME-609 that combats herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which is responsible for causing herpes labialis.

The statement discusses a study on Egyptian patients with chronic liver cirrhosis associated with previous hepatic Schistosomiasis infection, focusing on the urinary ratio of 6 beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol (6 beta-OHC/C) as a biomarker of CYP3A4 metabolizing activity. While this study may provide valuable insights into how liver cirrhosis affects enzyme activity in these patients, it does not mention hydrocortisone treatment for cirrhosis at all.

        The misconception might arise from conflating two separate concepts - using a biomarker (6 beta-OHC/C) to study enzyme activity in cirrhotic patients versus treating cirrhosis of the liver with hydrocortisone. Although both statements involve liver cirrhosis, they represent different aspects of liver disease investigation and management.

        To establish indirect support for hydrocortisone treatment of cirrhosis from such a statement, one would need evidence suggesting that CYP3A"

The statement reports a case where hydrocortisone was used in combination with other drugs for treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia that had relapsed with meningeal involvement after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The patient experienced fatal complications related to Adult Trauma Life Support (ATLS). However, it does not imply that hydrocortisone is an effective treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The statement only shows an association between hydrocortisone usage and leukemia in this specific case; it does not demonstrate causation or treatment efficacy."

The statement indicates that a patient with HIV infection showed improvement in signs and symptoms after antituberculous and hydrocortisone treatment, but it does not necessarily imply that hydrocortisone was responsible for treating HIV infection specifically. Hydrocortisone is known for its anti-inflammatory effects which could have contributed to improving symptoms in general without specifically targeting HIV infection itself. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to conclude that hydrocortisone is an effective treatment for HIV infectious disease based solely on this statement."

The statement discusses cortisol levels in patients with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Ebola, and SARS, but it does not mention hydrocortisone treatment for SARS patients specifically. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol; however, without direct evidence linking hydrocortisone therapy to improved outcomes in SARS patients, no conclusions can be drawn regarding its efficacy in treating SARS.

        To further elaborate on this response, let us consider some important aspects of interpreting medical evidence in relation to therapeutic interventions.

        1. Specificity of intervention: The statement does not explicitly mention hydrocortisone as an intervention for SARS patients; therefore, it cannot provide indirect support for its use in treating SARS.

        2. Context of cortisol elevation: While cortisol levels may be elevated in patients suffering from various respiratory illnesses like RSV, Ebola, and SARS, it"

The study mentioned in the statement investigates the elimination of exogenous cortisol from the blood in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Exogenous cortisol refers to synthetic cortisol administered externally, not hydrocortisone specifically. Hydrocortisone is endogenous cortisol produced naturally within the body; thus, it is not covered under exogenous cortisol elimination in this context.

         The misconception might arise from assuming that any form of cortisol would have similar effects on MI treatment due to their shared functions as glucocorticoids. However, hydrocortisone has not been explicitly mentioned in relation to treating MI in this study. Therefore, it is inappropriate to infer any supportive evidence for hydrocortisone as an MI treatment based on this statement alone."

        The statement discusses the effects of retinoic acid treatment on dogs with ACTH-secreting tumors, focusing on its ability to control ACTH and cortisol hyperactivity and reduce tumor size, leading to resolution of the clinical phenotype. However, it does not mention hydrocortisone at all, let alone its potential therapeutic effects on neoplasms (tumors). Therefore, there is no basis for inferring any relationship between hydrocortisone and tumor treatment in this context.

        That being said, it is important to note that hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid often used in medical treatments for various conditions, including some cancers, due to its anti-inflammatory properties. However, without explicit reference to hydrocortisone in the statement provided, it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions about its effects on neoplasms based on this information alone."

        The statement in question is a study on diurnal cortisol levels in schizophrenia patients who have experienced childhood trauma. Cortisol is a stress hormone that follows a diurnal rhythm, meaning it has daily fluctuations in its levels. This study is relevant in understanding how early life trauma can affect cortisol levels in individuals with schizophrenia, but it does not provide any information about hydrocortisone, which is a synthetic form of cortisol used as medication in certain medical conditions. 

        Hydrocortisone is often used in clinical settings for its anti-inflammatory effects and its ability to suppress the immune system in conditions like adrenal insufficiency, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and other inflammatory conditions. The use of hydrocortisone in treating injuries is not a common practice unless there is an underlying inflammatory response that needs control.

         The statement suggests that hydrocortisone is used in treating ulcerative colitis, which implies that hydrocortisone has some therapeutic effect on the condition. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean that hydrocortisone is the sole treatment for ulcerative colitis or that it is effective in all cases. The statement also specifies ""local"" hydrocortisone, which could mean that it is used in specific ways or in conjunction with other treatments. Therefore, while there is support for the claim that hydrocortisone can be used in treating ulcerative colitis, it is not a direct claim that hydrocortisone is the only or best treatment for the condition."

        The statement lists hydrocortisone as one of the treatments for alopecia areata, partialis, and totalis. Diffuse alopecia areata is a subtype of alopecia areata, characterized by hair loss over the entire scalp rather than in patches (as in classic alopecia areata). Therefore, if hydrocortisone is effective for alopecia areata, it stands to reason that it could also be effective for diffuse alopecia areata, given that they share similar pathophysiological mechanisms related to autoimmunity. However, it is important to note that further studies specifically addressing diffuse alopecia areata would be necessary for more direct support of hydrocortisone as an effective treatment for that specific subtype of alopecia areata."

The statement discusses phenylbutazone and compound F as treatments for osteoarthritis of the hip but does not mention hydrocortisone as a treatment option in any capacity.

        However, it is important to note that while hydrocortisone is not mentioned in this specific study, it has been studied as an alternative treatment for osteoarthritis due to its anti-inflammatory properties (1). Intra-articular injections of hydrocortisone have been shown in some studies to provide short-term pain relief in patients suffering from osteoarthritis (2). Nonetheless, based on the information provided in the original statement alone, there is no evidence supporting hydrocortisone as an effective treatment for osteoarthritis of the hip.

The study referenced in the statement investigates the interaction of endogenous growth hormone, cortisol, and catecholamines with blood glucose in children with brittle diabetes mellitus. Cortisol is one of the hormones being studied in its natural state (endogenous), not as an administered treatment (exogenous). Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol; however, no claim is made in the statement about its therapeutic use for type 1 diabetes mellitus.

        The misinterpretation could arise from conflating endogenous cortisol (a hormone naturally produced in the body) with exogenous hydrocortisone (a synthetic drug). While both substances have similar effects on blood glucose levels due to their glucocorticoid properties, they should not be used interchangeably in this context because they represent different aspects of cortisol in diabetes management - one being a factor in disease pathophysiology (cortisol),"

However, it does not provide direct evidence that hydrocortisone specifically treats BPD since it is possible that other factors could have contributed to the outcomes observed in these infants.

         It is important to note that while an indirect association between hydrocortisone use and potential benefits for BPD can be inferred from this study design, further investigation would be required to establish causality and determine the specific efficacy of hydrocortisone in treating BPD.

         The reason for this is that hydrocortisone is a component of the treatment (ua-hydrocortisone) mentioned in the statement. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid often used in treating various forms of dermatitis, including atopic dermatitis (eczema). Urea is an additional component that can help improve skin hydration and penetration of other substances into the skin. Therefore, even though the statement refers to urea-hydrocortisone as a whole treatment, it does provide indirect evidence supporting hydrocortisone as an effective treatment for atopic dermatitis.

         The study investigates the interactions of leptin, insulin, and cortisol in obese children and adolescents at different stages of maturation. While cortisol is mentioned, it is not explicitly stated that hydrocortisone (a synthetic form of cortisol) was used as a treatment for obesity in the study participants. Therefore, there is no direct or indirect evidence provided in the statement to support the claim that hydrocortisone treats obesity disorder.

         However, it is important to note that increased cortisol levels (natural or synthetic) have been linked to weight gain in some studies due to its influence on metabolism, appetite regulation, and fat distribution [1]. Nonetheless, using hydrocortisone as a treatment for obesity is not a common practice due to its potential side effects and risks [2]. Further investigation into specific studies or evidence would be required to definitively support such a claim.

This is because hydrocortisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that closely resembles cortisol in its structure and function (Vahdat et al., 2008). Cortisol is a vital hormone in managing stress responses in humans, including sepsis (Annane et al., 2017).

        In critically ill patients with sepsis, cortisol levels may be insufficient due to relative adrenal insufficiency (RAI) (Annane et al., 2017). Hydrocortisone can be used as replacement therapy in these cases since it can mimic cortisol's effects on the body (Vahdat et al., 2008).

The statement mentions that low dose hydrocortisone treatment in patients with septic shock resulted in significant clinical improvement and reduced mortality. Toxic shock syndrome is a severe form of sepsis caused by bacterial infections (CDC, 2021). Since hydrocortisone has shown benefits in treating sepsis (septic shock), it could potentially be beneficial in managing toxic shock syndrome as well due to shared underlying pathophysiology (e.g., excessive inflammation). However, it is important to note that toxic shock syndrome is often associated with specific bacterial species (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus), so further investigation is required before making definitive conclusions about hydrocortisone as an effective treatment for toxic shock syndrome specifically.

The study mentions the use of low-dose daily hydrocortisone in combination with intravenous docetaxel 70 mg/m2 and oral estramustine in men with castration-resistant prostate carcinoma (HRPC) who demonstrated progression after initial hormone therapy. However, it does not explicitly state that hydrocortisone treats castration-resistant prostate carcinoma on its own.

         The presence of hydrocortisone in a treatment regimen for HRPC suggests that it may have some therapeutic benefit in managing this condition; however, it is crucial to consider that hydrocortisone is used alongside other treatments in this study. Therefore, any potential positive effects could be attributed to synergy between hydrocortisone and other agents rather than hydrocortisone alone having an impact on castration-resistant prostate carcinoma.

         It is essential to emphasize that further investigation is required before drawing definitive conclusions about hydrocortisone's effectiveness in treating castration-resistant prostate carcinoma based solely on"

The study mentioned measures cortisol levels in response to ACTH infusion in women with fibromyalgia and healthy controls. While hydrocortisone is a glucocorticoid that can increase cortisol levels in the body, there is no direct link established between ACTH-induced cortisol increases and hydrocortisone treatment for fibromyalgia in this statement.

        To provide indirect support for the claim that hydrocortisone treats fibromyalgia, one would need evidence showing that hydrocortisone administration results in improved symptoms or outcomes in fibromyalgia patients compared to untreated individuals or those receiving placebo treatment. The current statement only demonstrates similar cortisol responses between fibromyalgia patients and healthy controls following ACTH infusion but does not provide information on hydrocortisone treatment specifically for fibromyalgia patients.

The statement ""The effects of endogenous opioids and cortisol on thyrotropin and prolactin secretion in patients with Addison's disease"" implies that cortisol has an effect on patients with Addison's disease. Cortisol is a hormone that is replaced in patients with Addison's disease through therapy such as hydrocortisone. Therefore, hydrocortisone, as a synthetic form of cortisol, would be used to treat chronic primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease). However, it is important to note that while this statement indirectly supports the use of hydrocortisone in treating Addison's disease, it does not provide direct evidence of its efficacy. Further studies would be needed to establish the therapeutic benefits of hydrocortisone in treating Addison's disease."

The statement ""Dynamics of the cortisol content in the blood plasma in specific hyposensibilization in children with bronchial asthma"" refers to changes in cortisol levels in children undergoing hyposensibilization therapy for bronchial asthma. Cortisol is a natural hormone produced by the adrenal gland that has anti-inflammatory properties similar to those of synthetic glucocorticoids like hydrocortisone. However, it does not imply that hydrocortisone is used as a treatment for asthma in these cases. To establish whether hydrocortisone treats asthma, one would need specific clinical trials or studies demonstrating its efficacy in treating asthma symptoms or preventing asthma attacks."

This is because X-linked lymphoproliferative disease (XLP) is a type of lymphoproliferative syndrome (LPS), as indicated by the first part of the statement. Therefore, if methylprednisolone is effective in treating XLP, it can be inferred that it may also be effective in treating other forms of LPS, including those not specifically mentioned in the statement. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect inference and further evidence would be required for a definitive conclusion about methylprednisolone's efficacy in treating all types of LPS."

The statement mentions methylprednisolone as part of a multi-drug treatment regimen for L1210 leukemia, which implies its use in treating leukemia. However, it is important to note that methylprednisolone is not typically used as a single-agent treatment for leukemia but rather as an adjunct in combination chemotherapy regimens.

        The study referenced in the statement appears to focus on circadian optimization of treatment rather than solely on methylprednisolone as a standalone treatment for leukemia. Therefore, while there is some level of support for methylprednisolone being used in leukemia treatment, it is not a direct endorsement of its efficacy as a single agent in treating leukemia.

        It is also crucial to consider that evidence from one study does not necessarily establish a definitive therapeutic approach for leukemia treatment. Comprehensive clinical trials and meta-anal"

        The statement suggests that methylprednisolone is used in therapy for angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy, which is a symptom of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL). Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, characterized by an abnormal proliferation of T-cells in the lymph nodes, leading to symptoms such as lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes). 

        Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid that has been used in various cancer treatments due to its anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to suppress immune responses. While methylprednisolone may not be a primary treatment for AITL, it can be used as an adjunct"

The statement describes seven patients with active AS who were treated with methylprednisolone for three successive days due to insufficient efficacy of NSAIDs for three months. The fact that methylprednisolone was used as a treatment in these patients suggests that it has potential therapeutic benefits for AS, even though it does not explicitly demonstrate that methylprednisolone treats AS.

         However, it is important to note that this evidence is limited in several ways. Firstly, it is an observational study without a control group, which makes it difficult to establish whether methylprednisolone is more effective than other treatments or placebo for AS. Secondly, there is no information about the long-term outcomes of these patients after receiving methylprednisolone treatment. Lastly, there is no mention of any statistical analysis of the results, which further limits the strength of the evidence provided.

The purpose of the study is to report the therapeutic efficacy of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) in patients with restrictive myopathy caused by thyroid eye disease (TED). This implies that methylprednisolone was used as a treatment for myopathy in the context of TED, thus providing indirect evidence that methylprednisolone can be used to treat myopathy. However, it is important to note that myopathy can have various causes, and this study specifically addresses myopathy caused by TED. Therefore, while the statement supports the idea that methylprednisolone can treat myopathy in certain circumstances, it does not necessarily mean that methylprednisolone is effective for all types of myopathy."

The patient's abdominal pain relief after two months of treatment that includes methylprednisolone suggests a potential link between methylprednisolone use and abdominal pain relief. However, it is important to note that this does not conclusively prove that methylprednisolone alone is responsible for the abdominal pain relief. Other factors such as cyclophosphamide and prednisone could also contribute to the effect, or the pain relief could be due to the natural progression of the disease being treated. Therefore, while there is some indirect support for the claim, more rigorous studies would be needed to establish a direct causal relationship between methylprednisolone and abdominal pain relief."

The study in rats suggests that early treatment with methylprednisolone can stabilize the blood-optic nerve barrier in rAION. This is relevant because disruption of the blood-optic nerve barrier is one of the pathological features of AION, contributing to vision loss. By stabilizing this barrier, methylprednisolone could potentially mitigate damage and improve visual outcomes in AION patients. However, it is important to note that this is an extrapolation from animal model data to human clinical application, which would require further rigorous clinical trials for confirmation."

The study by Van Zele et al reports positive results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial using methylprednisolone for the treatment of nasal polyps. However, it is important to note that the study also used doxycycline as a treatment arm, so it does not directly demonstrate that methylprednisolone is more effective than placebo in treating nasal polyps. Additionally, the specific tapering schedule used in the study may have an impact on its efficacy. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, further research would be needed to make a definitive conclusion about the effectiveness of methylprednisolone for treating nasal polyps."
15407991,Methylprednisolone treats radiculopathy,1256,"Herein, we present our experience of management of such cases with a single epidural injection of local anaesthetic, tramadol and methylprednisolone, and table tilt for management of both radiculopathies.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Methylprednisolone treats radiculopathy"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Herein, we present our experience of management of such cases with a single epidural injection of local anaesthetic, tramadol and methylprednisolone, and table tilt for management of both radiculopathies.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Methylprednisolone treats radiculopathy"". The statement mentions that in their experience, healthcare providers have managed radiculopathies using an epidural injection containing methylprednisolone along with other substances (local anaesthetic and tramadol). Methylprednisolone is a type of corticosteroid that is often used in epidural injections for its anti-inflammatory properties, which can help alleviate pain caused by radiculopathy by reducing inflammation in the affected area.

         However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation; therefore, while methylprednisolone may be associated with symptom improvement in radiculopathy patients due to its anti-inflammatory effects, it does not necessarily mean that methylprednisolone is solely responsible for treating radiculopathy in these cases. Further studies would be required to establish more definitive evidence regarding methylprednisolone's efficacy in treating radiculopathy specifically."

The statement suggests that early high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone is effective in preserving retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in patients with NMO. This implies that methylprednisolone has a positive effect on the condition of NMO patients, thus providing indirect evidence that it can be used to treat NMO. However, it is important to note that treatment efficacy is typically evaluated based on clinical outcomes such as relapse rate, disability progression, and patient quality of life, rather than just surrogate markers like retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, more direct evidence would be needed for a definitive conclusion."

West syndrome is one of the most common types of infantile spasms, which is a severe epileptic disorder in infants. Therefore, if methylprednisolone is effective in treating infantile spasms, it could be inferred that it may also be effective in treating West syndrome specifically. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect inference and further evidence would be needed to confirm that methylprednisolone is indeed an effective treatment for West syndrome. Additionally, it should be considered that the authors' report is based on their own experience, which may not be representative of all cases or populations. Therefore, more rigorous clinical trials would be necessary for definitive conclusions to be drawn about the efficacy of methylprednisolone in treating West syndrome."

The objective of the study explicitly mentions using methylprednisolone as part of transtympanic steroids (TTS) treatment for Meniere's disease (MD). By describing the long-term efficacy of TTS using methylprednisolone in treating MD, it implies that methylprednisolone could play a significant role in alleviating symptoms associated with Meniere disease. However, it is important to note that further investigation of the study results is required to draw definitive conclusions about methylprednisolone's specific efficacy in treating Meniere disease."

The provided statement only mentions that rats with Walker 256 tumors were treated with methylprednisolone among other substances from Days 6 through 10 following implantation. It does not provide any information about the outcomes of these treatments nor does it establish a causal link between methylprednisolone administration and tumor treatment. In order for there to be indirect support for such a claim, there should be some evidence suggesting that tumor growth was inhibited or reduced as a result of methylprednisolone treatment in these rats; however, such evidence is absent from the given statement."

The conclusion states that treatment with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide in children with Grade IV IgAN resulted in stabilized renal function and significant reductions in hematuria, proteinuria, mesangial IgA deposition, and the renal pathological activity index.

         These improvements suggest that methylprednisolone has a positive impact on managing IgAN symptoms in children, providing indirect evidence for its therapeutic efficacy in treating IgAN. However, it is important to note that the statement does not explicitly demonstrate that methylprednisolone alone treats IgAN since it was used in combination with cyclophosphamide in the study. Further investigation would be required to establish whether methylprednisolone has similar effects when administered independently of other treatments.

         Additionally, it should be emphasized that while the statement provides some evidence for methylprednisolone as an effective treatment for IgAN in children, it does not"

         The statement suggests that MN was initially given methylprednisolone as a treatment for her condition, which was later identified as membranous glomerulonephritis (MN). The use of methylprednisolone as first-line therapy implies that it was effective in treating MN to some degree, as it is common practice to begin treatment with medications that have proven efficacy for the specific condition. Therefore, even though the statement does not explicitly state that methylprednisolone treats MN, the implied causality between the administration of methylprednisolone and the treatment of MN provides indirect support for the claim.

         However, it is important to note that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, so further evidence would be required for definitive support of the claim that methylprednisolone treats MN. Additionally, factors such as individual patient response, con"

The case report describes a patient suffering from hemophagocytic syndrome during the convalescent phase of Dengue type II who was successfully treated primarily with pulse methylprednisolone and high dose intravenous immunoglobulin G. This suggests that methylprednisolone may have contributed to the successful treatment of hemophagocytic syndrome in this particular case.

The study suggests that methylprednisolone, when used in combination with conventional medical therapy, can improve lung function values and nocturnal oxyhemoglobin saturation in clinically stabilized COPD patients who experience nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation. This implies that methylprednisolone has a positive impact on COPD symptoms and related conditions such as nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation.

         However, it is important to note that ""treats"" is a strong word that implies a causal relationship and complete resolution of the disease. The provided statement does not explicitly state that methylprednisolone alone can treat COPD; rather it suggests that it may be beneficial as an adjunct therapy for certain COPD patients under specific conditions (i.e., clinically stabilized patients experiencing nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation).

In fact, it seems to suggest that methylprednisolone, along with other treatments, was ineffective in managing MAS in this particular case. The patient's condition worsened after three weeks of treatment, leading to a fatal cerebral edema within 24 hours of observation. This suggests that methylprednisolone may not be an effective treatment for MAS in all cases, and further research is needed to determine its efficacy in different patient populations and under different treatment conditions."

The conclusion of the pilot study suggests that a combination therapy including intravenous Methylprednisolone (IV MP), Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF), and low-dose Glucocorticoids (GC) might yield positive clinical, functional, and radiological results in patients suffering from severe early Systemic Sclerosis (SSc).

        
        Although the statement does not explicitly claim that Methylprednisolone treats systemic sclerosis on its own, it does imply that IV MP is an effective component of a treatment regimen for SSc patients when used in combination with other medications (MMF and GC). This finding supports the broader idea that Methylprednisolone can play a positive role in treating systemic sclerosis within specific therapeutic contexts and combinations.

        
        However, it is important to note that further investigation is required before drawing definitive conclusions about Methylprednisolone's standalone efficacy in treating systemic sclerosis due to the lack of direct evidence in the statement provided. Additionally, considering potential side"

         The statement suggests that dysthyroid optic neuropathy (an optic nerve disorder) is best treated with intravenous pulsed methylprednisolone. This implies that methylprednisolone is an effective treatment for this specific optic nerve disorder. Therefore, it can be inferred that methylprednisolone does indeed treat certain types of optic nerve disorders, providing indirect support for the initial phrase. However, it is important to note that methylprednisolone may not be effective for all types of optic nerve disorders, as suggested by the mention of surgical decompression in cases where visual functions do not recover."

        The statement suggests that methylprednisolone is used in treating bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. While it does not explicitly state that methylprednisolone treats BPD, it implies that it is used as a treatment strategy. The development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy could be a complication of BPD itself or potentially an adverse effect of methylprednisolone treatment. However, without further information about the context of this statement and additional evidence, it is impossible to definitively conclude that methylprednisolone treats BPD.

        
        Nonetheless, it is important to note that corticosteroids like methylprednisolone have been used in treating BPD due to their anti-inflammatory properties, which can help reduce lung injury and promote lung maturation in preterm infants (Jobe & Ikegami, 200"

The statement indicates that a patient diagnosed with multiple myeloma of Stage IIa was given cytostatic therapy that included methylprednisolone as part of her treatment regimen. This suggests that methylprednisolone is used in the treatment of multiple myeloma, which is a type of plasma cell myeloma. However, it is important to note that methylprednisolone is often used in combination with other drugs for treating multiple myeloma, so it may not be solely responsible for treating the condition. Additionally, further studies would be needed to establish a direct causal relationship between methylprednisolone use and improved outcomes in patients with plasma cell myeloma."

The statement suggests that methylprednisolone, when used in combination with cyclophosphamide, can improve cognitive dysfunction in certain forms of multiple sclerosis. This implies that methylprednisolone has some therapeutic effect on cognitive impairment, even though it is not acting alone in this particular treatment regimen. However, it is important to note that cognitive impairment is just one aspect of multiple sclerosis, and more specific studies would be needed to definitively say that methylprednisolone treats cognitive impairment in all its forms."

The methods section of the study outlines a randomized controlled trial where patients diagnosed with acute vestibular neuritis were given either methylprednisolone, placebo, valacyclovir, or methylprednisolone plus valacyclovir. This design allows for comparison between treatment groups and control groups, which can help establish whether methylprednisolone has an effect on vestibular neuronitis symptoms.

         However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy. The results of the study must be analyzed before making any conclusions about methylprednisolone's effectiveness in treating vestibular neuronitis. The study should also meet certain quality standards such as adequate sample size, appropriate statistical analysis, and transparent reporting of results in order for its conclusions to be considered reliable."

The original claim suggests that high-dose methylprednisolone can induce remissions in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who have p53 abnormalities. This implies that methylprednisolone has some therapeutic effect on CLL, specifically in those individuals where p53 function is compromised.

        
        While the original statement does not explicitly state that methylprednisolone treats all cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, it does provide evidence that methylprednisolone has some efficacy in treating CLL patients with p53 abnormalities. This suggests that there may be a subset of CLL patients who could potentially benefit from methylprednisolone treatment, although more extensive clinical trials would be required to confirm this hypothesis and determine its applicability in broader clinical settings.

The high proportion of SARS patients who received methylprednisolone treatment suggests that there may be some therapeutic benefit associated with its use in treating SARS. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. Therefore, while this statement supports an association between methylprednisolone use and SARS treatment, it does not definitively prove that methylprednisolone is an effective treatment for SARS.

The statement refers to ""HDMP,"" which is an abbreviation for high-dose methylprednisolone. While it suggests that HDMP should be explored in certain patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), it does not mention myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), which are a distinct category of hematological malignancies. MPNs include conditions such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis, which have different pathophysiological mechanisms compared to AML. Therefore, even though both conditions involve abnormal blood cell production, the statement does not offer any evidence or suggestion that methylprednisolone would be an effective treatment for MPNs."

The study is investigating the effect of high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) on blast reduction rate in patients with ALL during the induction remission period. This suggests that methylprednisolone is being used as a treatment for ALL, as one of the main goals of treatment during induction remission is to reduce blast cells, which are immature blood cells that can accumulate and lead to complications in leukemia patients.

         However, it is important to note that while this study supports methylprednisolone as part of the treatment regimen for ALL patients during induction remission, it does not necessarily mean that methylprednisolone alone can treat ALL. It is likely that methylprednisolone is used in combination with other treatments as part of a standard protocol for ALL management. Therefore, further investigation would be required to determine the specific efficacy of methylprednisolone in treating ALL."

The case description mentions that a patient was treated with methylprednisolone for Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), which is a form of immunoglobulin A (IgA) vasculitis but does not explicitly state that methylprednisolone was used specifically for treating IgA vasculitis in this case.

         Henoch-Schonlein purpura is an IgA vasculitis that primarily affects children but can also occur in adults. It is characterized by inflammation of small blood vessels (vasculitis) due to an abnormal immune response involving IgA antibodies. Methylprednisolone is often used as an anti-inflammatory agent in treating various autoimmune conditions, including vasculitides like HSP.

The key word here is ""indirect"" because it does not explicitly state that methylprednisolone alone is effective in treating lupus nephritis, but it does associate methylprednisolone with successful treatment outcomes in conjunction with cyclophosphamide.

        To break it down further, let's consider what we know about lupus nephritis and its treatment. Lupus nephritis is a severe complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that can lead to kidney failure if left untreated (1). Therefore, developing effective treatments for lupus nephritis is of paramount importance in managing SLE.

        The statement highlights cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone as having made a significant breakthrough in treating lupus nephritis. Cyclophosphamide is an immunosuppressive drug often used in combination therapy for severe lupus nephritis (2). Methylprednisolone is a type of"

The statement indicates that Methylprednisolone suleptanate (Promedrol), which is a prodrug of methylprednisolone, is being developed for the treatment of asthma by Pharmacia Corp (formerly Pharmacia & Upjohn). A prodrug is an inactive form of a drug that is metabolically converted into its active form in the body. In this case, Methylprednisolone suleptanate is metabolically converted into Methylprednisolone in the body. Methylprednisolone is a type of corticosteroid that is often used in treating asthma due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, if Methylprednisolone suleptanate is approved for use in treating asthma, it would indirectly support the claim that Methylprednisolone treats asthma because it would be an indirect route for administering Methylprednisolone for asthma treatment.

The statement suggests that there has been a study on the efficacy of Methylprednisolone in treating Bell's palsy that has less than 12 days of evolution when used in conjunction with Aciclovir. However, it doesn't provide direct evidence of Methylprednisolone's efficacy as a standalone treatment for Bell's palsy.

         It is important to note that while this statement suggests a potential benefit of Methylprednisolone in treating Bell's palsy, it does not constitute definitive proof of its efficacy. Further research is needed to establish the drug's effectiveness as a treatment for Bell's palsy, including randomized controlled trials that compare Methylprednisolone to placebo or other treatments.

The study design is robust as it includes a control group and three treatment groups, one of which includes methylprednisolone. However, it's important to note that the statement does not directly prove that methylprednisolone treats sinusitis, but rather it suggests a potential beneficial effect that warrants further investigation.

         The study design is crucial here. By comparing outcomes in rabbits treated with methylprednisolone to those in a control group, the study can identify any differences in outcomes that may suggest a treatment effect. If rabbits in the methylprednisolone group show improved resolution of sinusitis compared to the control group, it would provide evidence for the potential therapeutic effect of methylprednisolone in treating sinusitis.

         However, there are several factors to consider before accepting this as definitive evidence. Firstly, the study is conducted in rabbits, not humans. The physiology of rabbits is not identical to humans, so it's possible that results may not translate directly. Secondly, the study only reports that rabbits were"

The statement is comparing two treatments, cyclophosphamide and methylprednisolone, in the context of treating neuropsychiatric involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). It does not provide evidence that methylprednisolone is an effective treatment for SLE itself. Therefore, it does not indirectly support the claim that methylprednisolone treats SLE.

         However, it is important to note that methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid often used in the treatment of SLE due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Its use is typically as an adjunct therapy in combination with other medications such as immunosuppressants (like cyclophosphamide) or antimalarials. The lack of randomized controlled trials comparing cyclophosphamide versus methylprednisolone does not negate the fact that methylprednisolone is used in treating SLE.

The statement ""High-dose methylprednisolone was administered for treatment of the pneumonitis"" suggests that methylprednisolone was used as a treatment for a lung inflammation condition (pneumonitis). Pneumonia is also a lung inflammation condition, often caused by infection. Therefore, it's reasonable to infer that if methylprednisolone is used for one type of lung inflammation (pneumonitis), it could potentially be used for another (pneumonia). However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference and does not constitute definitive proof that methylprednisolone is an effective treatment for pneumonia. The two conditions, while sharing similar symptoms, have different underlying causes and may require different treatments. Therefore, further research would be needed to confirm whether methylprednisolone is an effective treatment for pneumonia specifically."

The statement suggests that IV methylprednisolone can be helpful in treating persistent Kawasaki Disease (KD), which is also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. Therefore, it implies that methylprednisolone has some therapeutic effect on KD. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference and does not provide direct evidence of methylprednisolone's efficacy in treating KD. The statement comes from a broader context where multiple treatments are being discussed for persistent KD, so it doesn't explicitly state that methylprednisolone is a standalone treatment for KD. Furthermore, it's crucial to consider that medical treatments should be based on robust clinical evidence and guidelines, not just isolated statements."
8095661,Methylprednisolone treats carpal tunnel syndrome,1294,Injection with methylprednisolone for carpal tunnel syndrome.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Methylprednisolone treats carpal tunnel syndrome"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Injection with methylprednisolone for carpal tunnel syndrome.""?","Yes, the statement ""Injection with methylprednisolone for carpal tunnel syndrome"" does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Methylprednisolone treats carpal tunnel syndrome."" This is because an injection of methylprednisolone into the carpal tunnel is a medical intervention typically used to alleviate symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Methylprednisolone is a type of corticosteroid that reduces inflammation, which is often the primary cause of discomfort in CTS patients.

         However, it is essential to acknowledge that while an injection of methylprednisolone can help manage CTS symptoms, it does not necessarily imply that methylprednisolone treats carpal tunnel syndrome in its entirety. Treatment generally refers to a definitive solution that addresses the underlying cause(s) of a condition and prevents its recurrence. In contrast, symptomatic relief focuses on alleviating distressing symptoms without necessarily addressing the root cause(s).

         Therefore, although there is indirect support for methylprednisolone treating CTS based on injections being used as an intervention for symptom relief, further investigation is required to establish whether meth"

The key term here is ""indirect support."" The statement describes a case where a patient diagnosed with Evans syndrome (a rare autoimmune disorder often associated with thrombocytopenia) received high-dose methylprednisolone therapy and achieved a complete response for thrombocytopenia. This suggests that methylprednisolone may have contributed to the improvement in thrombocytopenia symptoms in this specific case.

         However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While it appears that methylprednisolone may have played a role in treating thrombocytopenia in this instance, we cannot definitively conclude that methylprednisolone is solely responsible for the improvement without further investigation into potential confounding factors (e.g., other treatments administered concurrently, spontaneous remission rates for Evans syndrome).

The ONTT (Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial) concluded that there was a significant reduction in the use of oral prednisone without first administering intravenous methylprednisolone in treating acute optic neuritis. This suggests that methylprednisolone is likely more effective than oral prednisone in treating optic neuritis, thus supporting the claim that methylprednisolone treats optic neuritis. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based on an indirect comparison derived from a trial design that primarily focused on comparing oral prednisone alone versus oral prednisone combined with intravenous methylprednisolone in treating optic neuritis. A direct comparison of methylprednisolone versus no treatment would provide stronger support for the claim that methylprednisolone treats optic neuritis."

The statement implies that Methylprednisolone treatment led to a reduction in inflammatory cell infiltrate, which is a marker of inflammation. Therefore, it suggests that Methylprednisolone has an anti-inflammatory effect. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference based on one specific experiment and may not necessarily generalize to all contexts or conditions. It would be more robust to consider multiple lines of evidence before making definitive conclusions about the efficacy of Methylprednisolone in treating inflammation."

The statement describes a case where high-dose pulse methylprednisolone therapy was used to treat a patient with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) with shock and ARDS resulting from Still's disease. This suggests that methylprednisolone may have contributed to the management of ARDS in this specific context.

         However, it is important to note that ARDS can have various causes, and methylprednisolone may not be universally effective in all cases. The statement does not provide direct evidence of methylprednisolone's efficacy in treating ARDS from other causes unrelated to Still's disease. Moreover, corticosteroids like methylprednisolone have potential side effects that should be carefully considered when making treatment decisions.

         In summary, while the statement offers some support for the use of methylprednisolone in treating ARDS associated with Still's disease, it does not conclusively establish that methylprednisolone is an effective treatment for all cases of adult AR"

However, it is important to note that myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is not exactly the same as eosinophilic fasciitis associated with myelodysplasia (MFMD). MDS is a group of disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis (blood cell production) in the bone marrow leading to cytopenia (reduced counts of one or more types of blood cells), while eosinophilic fasciitis is an inflammatory condition affecting fascia (connective tissue beneath the skin) that can be associated with myelodysplasia but is not identical to it. Therefore, while methylprednisolone may be an effective treatment for some cases of MFMD, further evidence is needed specifically addressing MDS before making definitive conclusions about its efficacy in treating MDS alone."

This is because osteomyelitis is an inflammatory condition affecting bone marrow caused by bacterial infection (NIH, 2021). If Cefotaxime is effective against chronic osteomyelitis caused by gram-negative bacilli (a type of bacteria), then it can be inferred that Cefotaxime indeed treats osteomyelitis in specific cases where gram-negative bacilli are responsible for causing the infection. However, it is essential to note that osteomyelitis can also be caused by other types of bacteria (such as gram-positive bacteria), for which Cefotaxime may not be an effective treatment option (CDC, 2019).

         The conduct of a clinical trial implies that there is some level of investigation into the potential therapeutic effects of Gefarnate for gastric ulcer disease. This suggests that there is a biological rationale for testing Gefarnate as a treatment for gastric ulcers, which may include preclinical studies demonstrating efficacy in animal models of gastric ulceration.

         However, it is important to note that while an individual clinical trial may support the potential utility of Gefarnate for treating gastric ulcers, definitive conclusions would require evaluation of all available evidence from multiple trials, including assessment of trial quality, consistency of results across studies, and potential sources of bias that may influence outcomes.

         In summary, while the statement does provide indirect support for Gefarnate as a treatment for gastric ulcers, definitive conclusions would require more extensive evaluation of all available evidence."

         The title of the study suggests that gefarnate was used in the treatment of duodenal ulcers. While it does not explicitly state that gefarnate treats duodenal ulcers, the context implies that gefarnate was used as a therapeutic agent for duodenal ulcers in the study. Therefore, there is indirect support for the claim that gefarnate treats duodenal ulcers based on this statement.

         However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy. To establish that gefarnate treats duodenal ulcers conclusively, one would need to examine the study methods, results, and conclusions in detail.

The reason is that the patients in the study were diagnosed with peptic ulcers and were given gefarnate as part of their treatment regimen in a double-blind comparative evaluation. This implies that there is some basis for believing that gefarnate may be an effective treatment for peptic ulcers, even though it does not explicitly prove that gefarnate is solely responsible for treating peptic ulcers in these patients.

         However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation. The fact that gefarnate was administered as part of treatment does not automatically mean that it was solely responsible for treating peptic ulcers in these patients. Other factors such as lifestyle changes, concomitant medications, and individual patient characteristics may have contributed to the treatment outcome as well.

         Additionally, it is crucial that any conclusions drawn from this study be considered preliminary until further research is conducted. A single study is rarely sufficient to establish definitive evidence of treatment efficacy in medical science. Further studies should be conducted in order to confirm these initial findings before any definitive conclusions can be drawn about gefarnate as"

        The statement suggests that Regadenoson is used as a vasodilator in Cardiac Transplant Perfusion (CTP) and Magnetic Resonance Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (MR MPI) in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). A vasodilator is a substance that widens blood vessels and improves blood flow. Coronary artery disorder refers to diseases that affect the coronary arteries, often leading to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. By acting as a vasodilator in CAD patients, Regadenoson could potentially improve blood flow in the coronary arteries, which may help alleviate symptoms of coronary artery disorder.

         The key term here is ""binds,"" which implies some form of physical interaction between Ciprofloxacin and DNA gyrase. This interaction is crucial for the antibiotic activity of Ciprofloxacin as it inhibits the function of DNA gyrase, thereby interfering with bacterial DNA replication and transcription processes.

The key term here is indirect support. The statement mentions that both topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase were purified from both ciprofloxacin-sensitive and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae using gene cloning methods in Escherichia coli. 

        Ciprofloxacin is known to be an inhibitor of bacterial DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV, which are essential for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination (Drlica et al., 1994). The fact that both sensitive and resistant strains of S. pneumoniae have these enzymes implies that ciprofloxacin could be interacting physically with DNA gyrase in these strains, as it is known to target these enzymes in other bacterial species as well.

The statement suggests that ciprofloxacin has an effect on topoisomerase IV, another type of enzyme involved in DNA replication. Topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase belong to the same family of enzymes known as type II topoisomerases. They have similar structures and functions but differ in their preferred substrates and roles in bacterial cells. DNA gyrase is primarily responsible for introducing negative supercoils into DNA, while topoisomerase IV is involved in DNA decatenation and relaxation of supercoiled DNA. 

         The fact that ciprofloxacin inhibits topoisomerase IV at lower concentrations than those required to inhibit DNA gyrase implies that ciprofloxacin has some level of interaction with DNA gyrase as well, albeit at higher concentrations. This is because these enzymes share similar structures and mechanisms of action, making it likely that ciprofloxacin would interact with both enzymes in related ways.

        The indirect support lies in the fact that if QnrB1 is protecting DNA gyrase from ciprofloxacin inhibition, it implies that ciprofloxacin has an effect on DNA gyrase in the first place. This is because QnrB1 is known to bind to DNA gyrase and prevent ciprofloxacin from interacting with its target site on DNA gyrase (Hooper & Jacoby, 2015). Therefore, if QnrB1 were not effective in protecting DNA gyrase from ciprofloxacin inhibition, it would suggest that ciprofloxacin does not affect DNA gyrase.

The study mentions that 34 patients with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis were treated with Ciprofloxacin for ten days, which suggests that Ciprofloxacin was used as a treatment for these patients experiencing chronic bronchitis exacerbations. However, it is important to note that treating acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis is not equivalent to treating chronic bronchitis itself, as acute exacerbations can be triggered by various factors such as bacterial infections, viral infections, or environmental factors. Therefore, while there is some support for Ciprofloxacin being used in treating chronic bronchitis patients during exacerbations, it does not necessarily mean that Ciprofloxacin can cure chronic bronchitis or prevent future exacerbations. Further studies would be required to establish such conclusions."

The phrase ""with Activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis"" suggests that Ciprofloxacin has antimicrobial properties against this specific bacterium, which is a causative agent of infection. However, it is important to note that this statement does not explicitly claim that Ciprofloxacin treats infections; it only implies that it may have the potential to do so by acting against the infectious agent.

         The nuance here lies in the fact that while Ciprofloxacin may have activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, its effectiveness in treating tuberculosis infections would depend on various factors such as its bioavailability at the site of infection, its ability to penetrate bacterial biofilms, potential development of resistance, and its safety profile in humans when used for extended periods. Therefore, while there is indirect support for the claim that Ciprofloxac"

The study mentioned is investigating the use of ciprofloxacin for antibacterial prophylaxis in patients undergoing autologous haematopoietic cell transplantation, specifically those with multiple myeloma and lymphoma. The purpose of administering ciprofloxacin in this context is to prevent bacterial infections during transplantation rather than treating lymphoma itself. Therefore, there is no indirect support for ciprofloxacin as a treatment for lymphoma in this study."

         The statement describes a case of septic arthritis in a patient with B-CLL, caused by a Mycoplasma salivarium strain resistant to Ciprofloxacin and Clarithromycin. This information indicates that Ciprofloxacin was ineffective against the Mycoplasma salivarium strain in this particular case, which is contrary to the claim that Ciprofloxacin treats B-CLL. 

         Furthermore, B-CLL is a type of cancer that affects B-cells, a type of white blood cell, and it is not typically treated with antibiotics like Ciprofloxacin. Instead, treatments often include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy, and stem cell transplantation. 

         Therefore, based on both the specifics of the case described and the general understanding of B-CLL treatment, the statement does not provide indirect support for the claim that"

        The statement provides evidence that a combination of ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime has been successful in treating hearing loss in a specific context. However, it does not necessarily follow that ciprofloxacin alone is responsible for treating hearing loss disorder. The observed improvement could be due to ceftazidime, synergistic effects of both drugs, or other uncontrolled factors in the study setting. Therefore, attributing the positive outcome solely to ciprofloxacin would be an overinterpretation of the evidence provided in the statement.

        
        To establish indirect support for ciprofloxacin treating hearing loss disorder specifically, additional evidence would be required that demonstrates its effectiveness in comparison to other treatments, in different contexts, and against various forms of hearing loss disorder. This would help establish ciprofloxacin as an independent treatment for hearing loss disorder"

In fact, it suggests potential adverse effects associated with ciprofloxacin use in treating sinusitis for this particular patient. The case summary describes a patient who experienced severe side effects after taking ciprofloxacin for sinusitis and urinary tract infections. This information indicates that while ciprofloxacin may be used to treat sinusitis, it can also lead to serious complications in some individuals. Therefore, it does not support the claim that ciprofloxacin is an effective treatment for sinusitis. Instead, it emphasizes the importance of monitoring patients for potential adverse reactions when prescribing antibiotics like ciprofloxacin."

The provided statement mentions Ciprofloxacin being used in conjunction with Meropenem to successfully treat Chromobacterium violaceum endocarditis and hepatic abscesses. This implies that Ciprofloxacin was effective in treating hepatic abscesses in this specific context. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily mean that Ciprofloxacin alone can treat liver abscesses in all cases, as it was used in combination therapy in this instance. Additionally, further studies would be needed to confirm its efficacy as a monotherapy for liver abscesses."

        The study mentioned appears to be a pharmacokinetics study, which primarily focuses on how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body, rather than its therapeutic effects. The title indicates that it compares two different doses of intravenous Ciprofloxacin in pleuro-pulmonary disease but it does not provide information on whether Ciprofloxacin is effective in treating lung disorders. Therefore, it does not provide indirect support for the claim that Ciprofloxacin treats lung disorders. 

        To establish whether Ciprofloxacin is effective in treating lung disorders, clinical trials that demonstrate its efficacy in treating specific lung disorders would be required. These trials would need to include control groups, randomization, and bl"

The statement ""Pneumococcal meningitis during ciprofloxacin therapy for otitis media"" discusses an adverse event (pneumococcal meningitis) that occurred during ciprofloxacin treatment for otitis media. This statement does not provide evidence that ciprofloxacin is effective in treating otitis media because it does not report on the outcomes of patients receiving ciprofloxacin therapy for otitis media (e.g., whether their symptoms improved). Instead, it highlights an unintended consequence of ciprofloxacin use in treating otitis media.

        To provide indirect support for the claim that ""Ciprofloxacin treats otitis media,"" one would need evidence suggesting that patients who received ciprofloxacin for otitis media experienced improvements in their symptoms compared to those who did not receive ciprofloxacin therapy. The statement provided does not contain such evidence; therefore, it does not support the claim that"

The conclusion drawn in the statement is about Ofloxacin being a more appropriate prophylactic choice for canine cataract patients due to its higher corneal penetration and ability to exceed MIC90 of common ocular contaminants compared to Ciprofloxacin. This statement discusses Ofloxacin's potential benefits in preventing infections in canine cataract patients but does not provide any evidence suggesting that Ciprofloxacin has any therapeutic effect on cataracts.

        To further clarify, higher corneal penetration and antibacterial efficacy of Ofloxacin compared to Ciprofloxacin imply that Ofloxacin might be more effective in preventing ocular infections in canine cataract patients; however, it does not indicate that Ciprofloxacin has any impact on treating cataracts. Cataracts are primarily managed through surgical intervention rather than pharmacological treatments like antibiotics; therefore, it is crucial to different"

This is because the study compares two treatments for uncomplicated cystitis in women, one of which is Ciprofloxacin. The fact that Ciprofloxacin is included in such a trial implies that it is considered a viable treatment option for cystitis. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof. The effectiveness of Ciprofloxacin in treating cystitis would need to be evaluated in the context of the specific study's results and design, as well as in relation to other relevant literature in the field."

The user's statement describes a case where a patient was diagnosed with a Pseudomonas toe web infection, which was then treated with oral ciprofloxacin and Castellani's paint. The fact that the infection was resolved suggests that the treatment was effective, thereby implying that ciprofloxacin can be used to treat Pseudomonas infections. However, it is important to note that this is an observational case report and does not provide direct evidence of causality between ciprofloxacin use and resolution of Pseudomonas infection. Further studies, such as randomized controlled trials, would be needed to establish a more robust evidence base for this claim."

         The title of the study suggests that ciprofloxacin is being considered as an alternative treatment for endophthalmitis, which is an inflammation of the internal tissue of the eye. This implies that ciprofloxacin has some efficacy in treating endophthalmitis, even though it may not be the first-line treatment like ceftazidime and amikacin. However, it is important to note that this support is indirect and based on the title alone; the full study would need to be evaluated for more direct support."

         The reason for this is that ciprofloxacin is listed as one of the fluoroquinolones that are widely used for treating bacterial infections. Fluoroquinolones are a class of antibiotics that work by killing or stopping the growth of bacteria. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that ciprofloxacin, as a member of this class of antibiotics, is used for treating bacterial infections. However, it is important to note that while this statement supports the claim indirectly, it does not constitute direct evidence that ciprofloxacin is used for treating bacterial infections in specific cases or under specific conditions.

The patient in question had bronchiectasis along with severe airway obstruction and responded positively to treatment involving ciprofloxacin in combination with clarithromycin.

        Bronchiectasis is characterized by abnormal widening of bronchi due to chronic inflammation and infection in the airways. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that can be used for treating infections caused by certain bacteria that may contribute to bronchiectasis progression (Banerjee et al., 2015). Clarithromycin is another antibiotic that can help reduce inflammation in bronchiectasis (Altenburg et al., 2014).

         The term ""intra-abdominal infections"" encompasses infections within the abdominal cavity, which can include conditions such as peritonitis, appendicitis, cholecystitis, and other abdominal organ infections. Therefore, it can be inferred that Ciprofloxacin is indeed used for treating certain types of abdominal infections based on this information. However, it is important to note that Ciprofloxacin may not be effective for all types of abdominal infections, especially those that are self-limiting or not serious in nature. It is always best to consult primary literature or clinical guidelines for more specific information regarding drug indications and efficacy."

         The statement provides evidence of a case where a patient with nasal rhinoscleroma was treated with ciprofloxacin and experienced resolution of their condition. This suggests that ciprofloxacin may be an effective treatment for rhinoscleroma, although it is important to note that this is based on a single case study. Ideally, larger clinical trials would be conducted to confirm these findings and establish the efficacy of ciprofloxacin for treating rhinoscleroma. Nonetheless, the statement does provide some level of support for the claim that ciprofloxacin can treat rhinoscleroma."

        The statement implies that ciprofloxacin is used in treating uncomplicated pyelonephritis in women, which suggests that ciprofloxacin has some therapeutic effect on pyelonephritis. However, it is essential to note that this is an indirect inference based on the information provided. The original statement does not explicitly claim that ciprofloxacin treats pyelonephritis; it only addresses the effectiveness of a specific treatment regimen (a 7-day course). Therefore, further investigation would be necessary to establish the direct relationship between ciprofloxacin and pyelonephritis treatment conclusively."
8337570,Ciprofloxacin treats bacterial infectious disease with sepsis,1360,"Despite prolonged bacteremia, the response to long-term therapy with ciprofloxacin and rifampin was excellent.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin treats bacterial infectious disease with sepsis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Despite prolonged bacteremia, the response to long-term therapy with ciprofloxacin and rifampin was excellent.""?","Yes, indirectly it does lend some support. The statement ""Despite prolonged bacteremia, the response to long-term therapy with ciprofloxacin and rifampin was excellent"" suggests that ciprofloxacin was effective in treating an infection caused by bacteria in the bloodstream (bacteremia), which is a symptom of sepsis. However, sepsis is a complex condition that often requires combination therapy (as mentioned in this case with rifampin) and intensive care unit management. Therefore, while the statement supports ciprofloxacin's efficacy against bacterial infections associated with sepsis, it does not explicitly state that ciprofloxacin treats sepsis itself."
8194797,Ciprofloxacin treats neutropenia,1361,The proportion of patients who developed neutropenia and fever was 87% in the group treated with ciprofloxacin and 78% in the group treated with ciprofloxacin and rifampin (P =.25).,False,"'Does the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin treats neutropenia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The proportion of patients who developed neutropenia and fever was 87% in the group treated with ciprofloxacin and 78% in the group treated with ciprofloxacin and rifampin (P =.25).""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin treats neutropenia."" The statement compares two groups treated with different regimens containing ciprofloxacin - one with ciprofloxacin alone and another with ciprofloxacin plus rifampin. It reports that a higher percentage of patients in the ciprofloxacin-only group developed neutropenia and fever compared to those in the combination therapy group (87% vs 78%). However, it does not indicate that ciprofloxacin treats neutropenia; rather, it may suggest that adding rifampin to ciprofloxacin could potentially reduce the incidence of neutropenia and fever in patients undergoing such treatment.

         Neutropenia is characterized by an abnormally low count of neutrophils - a type of white blood cell responsible for defending against infections. Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic used primarily for treating bacterial infections; it does not directly target neutropenia as it is not designed to increase"
8190776,Ciprofloxacin treats peritonitis,1362,"Peritonitis due to S. aureus ESI was significantly less frequent among patients treated with ciprofloxacin (1 vs 9 cases, p = 0.001).",True,"'Does the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin treats peritonitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Peritonitis due to S. aureus ESI was significantly less frequent among patients treated with ciprofloxacin (1 vs 9 cases, p = 0.001).""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the claim that ""Ciprofloxacin treats peritonitis"". The study found that there was a significant difference in peritonitis cases due to S. aureus between patients treated with ciprofloxacin (1 case) and those not treated with ciprofloxacin (9 cases). The lower frequency of peritonitis among patients treated with ciprofloxacin suggests that ciprofloxacin may have contributed to treating peritonitis in these cases. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation; further studies would be needed to establish whether ciprofloxacin is indeed an effective treatment for peritonitis caused by S. aureus specifically."
8088120,Ciprofloxacin treats Fever,1363,"In the current study, the authors examined the use of ciprofloxacin as outpatient management in selected patients with fever during an episode of neutropenia.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin treats Fever"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""In the current study, the authors examined the use of ciprofloxacin as outpatient management in selected patients with fever during an episode of neutropenia.""?","No, the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin treats Fever"" does not receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""In the current study, the authors examined the use of ciprofloxacin as outpatient management in selected patients with fever during an episode of neutropenia.""

        
        The statement from the study indicates that ciprofloxacin was used in managing fever during an episode of neutropenia in selected patients as outpatient care. However, it does not provide evidence that ciprofloxacin treats fever itself. Neutropenia is a condition characterized by low levels of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell) in the body, making patients more susceptible to infections. The study might be investigating whether ciprofloxacin can help prevent these infections in neutropenic patients who have fever as a symptom rather than treating fever directly.

        
        It is important to differentiate between treating fever as a symptom versus preventing infections that cause fever in neutropenic patients when interpreting this evidence. The misinterpretation of such relationships could lead to in"

The reason is that the statement mentions ciprofloxacin as one of three oral fluoroquinolones being analyzed for their efficacy and safety in treating chronic osteomyelitis. This implies that ciprofloxacin is being considered as a potential treatment option for osteomyelitis in the study. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of effectiveness; it simply suggests that further investigation into ciprofloxacin as an osteomyelitis treatment is warranted based on the study mentioned in the statement."

The key phrase here is ""the use of ciprofloxacin in cystic fibrosis."" This implies that ciprofloxacin is indeed used in treating cystic fibrosis, at least in certain cases and under specific conditions (i.e., carefully selected indications). However, it does not provide direct evidence that ciprofloxacin is an effective treatment for cystic fibrosis in general. It is important to note that while this statement suggests that ciprofloxacin is used in treating cystic fibrosis, it does not necessarily mean that it is a primary or sole treatment for the disease. Further research would be needed to fully understand the efficacy of ciprofloxacin in treating cystic fibrosis."

The study aims to investigate the clinical importance of ciprofloxacin efficacy in treating massive diarrhea in patients after EBR + ICVR. This implies that ciprofloxacin is being used as a potential treatment for diarrheal disease in this specific patient population. However, it is important to note that direct support would require results demonstrating that ciprofloxacin is indeed effective in treating diarrhea in these patients."

The statement describes a randomized trial where adults with uncomplicated typhoid fever were treated with either azithromycin or ciprofloxacin. The fact that ciprofloxacin was used in a trial for treating typhoid fever suggests that it has some clinical efficacy against the disease. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy. The specific results of the trial, such as the success rate of ciprofloxacin in treating typhoid fever, would provide more direct support for the claim."
7337248,Ciprofloxacin treats pneumonia,1368,Initial treatment of severe pneumonia with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly less subsequent gram-negative infection and was associated with substantially lower curative costs.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin treats pneumonia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Initial treatment of severe pneumonia with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly less subsequent gram-negative infection and was associated with substantially lower curative costs.""?","Yes, the statement ""Initial treatment of severe pneumonia with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly less subsequent gram-negative infection and was associated with substantially lower curative costs"" does provide indirect support for the claim that ""Ciprofloxacin treats pneumonia."" 

         The statement suggests that ciprofloxacin is an effective treatment for severe pneumonia, as it leads to less subsequent gram-negative infection, which is often a complication in pneumonia cases. Furthermore, it indicates that ciprofloxacin is associated with lower curative costs, implying that it may be a cost-effective treatment option for pneumonia. 

         However, it is important to note that while this statement supports ciprofloxacin as an effective treatment for severe pneumonia, it does not necessarily mean that ciprofloxacin is the only effective treatment for pneumonia. Other factors such as patient health status, drug resistance patterns, potential side effects, and patient preferences should also be considered when making treatment decisions for pneumonia."

         The statement indicates that Ciprofloxacin (CIP) is an antibacterial drug used for treating serious infections in humans. Antibacterial drugs like Ciprofloxacin target bacteria that cause infections in humans; thus, it indirectly supports that Ciprofloxacin treats infectious diseases caused by bacterial agents.

         However, it is essential to note that Ciprofloxacin is not effective against all types of infectious diseases; it primarily targets bacterial infections. Additionally, its use should be based on appropriate diagnosis and prescription by medical professionals due to potential side effects and antibiotic resistance concerns."

This suggests that ciprofloxacin has been used in treating active Crohn's disease, but it does not explicitly state that ciprofloxacin treats Crohn disease. It is important to note that while antibiotics like ciprofloxacin may be used in treating symptoms of Crohn disease, they do not cure the disease itself. Therefore, while there is some support for the use of ciprofloxacin in managing Crohn disease, it would be inaccurate to say that it treats Crohn disease without further qualification or context."

         The statement suggests that chloramphenicol has been used in treating bacterial infections of the central nervous system (CNS). Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including those that cause meningitis, which is an infection of the CNS (Brown & Cunha, 2017). Therefore, even though the statement does not explicitly claim that chloramphenicol treats bacterial infectious disease, it does provide evidence that chloramphenicol has been used in treating bacterial infections in the CNS, which supports the claim that chloramphenicol is used for treating bacterial infectious diseases.

         However, it is important to note that while chloramphenicol is effective against many types of bacteria, its use is associated with several adverse effects, including bone marrow suppression (Brown & Cunha, 2017). Therefore"

The statement provides evidence of a successful treatment of an infant with Enterobacter osteomyelitis using chloramphenicol in combination with rifampicin. However, it is important to note that antibiotic treatment should always be guided by susceptibility testing results as well as patient-specific factors such as age, allergies, comorbidities, and potential drug interactions. The success of chloramphenicol in treating osteomyelitis in one case does not automatically mean it will be effective in all cases involving osteomyelitis caused by Enterobacter species."

The writers' consultation of a wide range of American, European, and British research from 1950 to the present indicates that they have conducted an extensive review of existing literature on the topic. Their assertion that ophthalmic chloramphenicol is demonstrably effective as a treatment for most superficial eye infections suggests that there is evidence supporting its use in treating such conditions.

         However, it is important to note that while this statement provides some level of support for the claim, it does not constitute direct evidence. Direct evidence would involve specific studies that demonstrate chloramphenicol's effectiveness in treating eye infections. Indirect evidence, such as the statement provided, relies on inference and interpretation of secondary sources.

         Additionally, it should be emphasized that while the statement suggests that chloramphenicol is safe and cost-effective, it does not provide specific details about these aspects. Safety can be relative depending on factors such as dosage, duration of use, and individual patient characteristics. Similarly, cost-effectiveness can be influenced by various factors including the specific formulation of ch"

The statement only mentions rebamipide as one of the drugs used for peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), but it does not provide any information about its efficacy in treating GERD compared to other drugs or as a standalone treatment. Therefore, it does not substantiate the claim that rebamipide treats GERD.

         To provide indirect support for the claim that rebamipide treats GERD, we would need information suggesting that rebamipide has a positive effect on GERD symptoms or healing rates compared to placebo or other treatments. This information would need to be derived from well-designed clinical trials or observational studies that control for potential confounding factors.

         In summary, while rebamipide may be used in treating GERD based on its approved indications in certain jurisdictions, the provided statement does not offer any evidence supporting its efficacy in treating GERD compared to other alternatives."

The phrase ""serve as a new strategy for the treatment of TMJ-OA"" implies that rebamipide has some therapeutic effect on Temporomandibular Joint Osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA), which is a form of osteoarthritis (OA). However, it is important to note that osteoarthritis can manifest in various parts of the body (e.g., knee, hip), so the statement does not necessarily mean that rebamipide is effective for all types of osteoarthritis. It would require further evidence to confirm whether rebamipide has similar therapeutic effects on other forms of osteoarthritis beyond TMJ-OA."

The conclusion suggests that Rebamipide (REB) and Diquafosol (DQS) may be effective in managing dry eye syndrome after photorefractive keratectomy (PK) based on ocular surface findings. However, it is important to note that while this statement supports Rebamipide's potential positive impact on dry eye syndrome, it does not necessarily confirm that Rebamipide is solely responsible for treating dry eye syndrome as other factors (e.g., Diquafosol) may also contribute to its efficacy in managing dry eye syndrome.

        In addition, it is crucial to consider that further investigation is required before making definitive conclusions about Rebamipide's ability to treat dry eye syndrome since this study only explores its potential benefits in managing dry eye syndrome after PK specifically. Additional studies examining Rebamipide's effects on dry eye syndrome in different contexts would provide stronger evidence for its overall efficacy in treating dry eye syndrome.

The objective of the study mentioned in the quote is to examine the involvement of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in the action of rebamipide, which implies that rebamipide has an action in ulcerative colitis (UC). This suggests that rebamipide has some therapeutic effect on UC, thus providing indirect support for the claim that rebamipide treats ulcerative colitis. However, it is important to note that this evidence is indirect and based on an assumption that the study found rebamipide to be effective in UC through HGF involvement. For a more definitive conclusion, access to the full study results would be required."

        The key term here is ""indirect support."" The statement indicates that Rebamipide is a gastro-protective drug developed specifically for treating peptic ulcer disease in Japan. This implies that Rebamipide has been designed and studied for its potential therapeutic effects on peptic ulcers.

        However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of the claim. To establish direct support for the claim that ""Rebamipide treats peptic ulcer disease,"" one would need more specific evidence demonstrating its efficacy in treating peptic ulcers through clinical trials or other rigorous studies.

         The key term here is ""used for the treatment,"" which implies that Rebamipide has been administered to patients with gastric ulcers as part of a therapeutic regimen. This suggests that Rebamipide has been shown in some capacity to alleviate symptoms of gastric ulcers or promote their healing, thus treating gastric ulcers. 

         However, it is important to note that ""treatment"" can encompass a wide range of interventions, from those that completely cure an ailment to those that merely manage symptoms. Therefore, while there is indirect support for Rebamipide treating gastric ulcers based on this statement alone, further investigation would be necessary to determine the specifics of Rebamipide's therapeutic effect on gastric ulcers."

The conclusion suggests that rebamipide may attenuate H. pylori-induced gastric inflammation by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and oxidant-mediated activation of NF-kappaB, which in turn decreases IL-8 production. Gastritis is characterized by inflammation of the stomach lining, often caused by H. pylori infections. By reducing inflammation, rebamipide could potentially alleviate symptoms of gastritis. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect inference based on the described mechanism of action; direct clinical evidence supporting rebamipide as a treatment for gastritis would provide stronger support for the claim."

The provided information indicates that dinutuximab treatment results in decreased MYCN expression in tumors on histology compared to control or IgG-treated tumors. However, it does not explicitly state that dinutuximab treats neoplasm (a type of new and abnormal growth of tissue in some part of the body), nor does it provide enough context for us to infer such a conclusion.

        To establish a stronger link between dinutuximab treatment and therapeutic effects on neoplasm, additional evidence would be required, such as clinical trials demonstrating improved patient outcomes (e.g., increased survival rates, reduced tumor size) following dinutuximab treatment.

        It is important to maintain rigorous standards when interpreting scientific evidence in order to avoid drawing overly broad conclusions based on limited information. While the provided statement suggests that dinutuximab may have an effect on tumor growth by decreasing MYCN expression, further investigation is necessary before making any definitive conclusions about its therapeutic potential for treating neoplasm."

         The statement suggests that Brentuximab vedotin is used in treating systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL), which is a specific type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). ALCL is an aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), which is a cancer that starts in white blood cells called lymphocytes. Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets CD30, a protein expressed on the surface of cells in ALCL.

         Although the statement does not explicitly claim that Brentuximab vedotin treats ALCL, it implies that Brentuximab vedotin is used as a treatment for sALCL patients who have not received prior systemic therapy. This indirectly supports the idea that Brentuximab ved"

The statement indicates that brentuximab-vedotin (BV) has demonstrated single-agent activity against neoplasm (a type of new abnormal growth of tissue in some part of the body), but it also mentions that tumours regrew during BV therapy. This suggests that while BV may have some effect on neoplasm, it is not a definitive treatment and tumours can still progress while on therapy. Therefore, the statement does not support the claim that BV treats neoplasm.

        
        The statement highlights an important aspect of cancer therapy - that even if a drug shows initial effectiveness in shrinking tumours (single-agent activity), cancer cells can adapt and develop resistance over time (tumours regrew during BV therapy).

         The statement suggests that BRENTUXIMAB VEDOTIN (BV) is an advancement in treating patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and frontline PTCL settings. Primary cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (PTCL) is a subtype of CTCL, meaning that it falls under the broader category of diseases that BV is indicated for treating.

         However, it is essential to note that while there is indirect support for BV treating PTCL based on the statement, it does not explicitly state that BV is used for primary cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma in either R/R or frontline settings. Therefore, further investigation would be necessary for more direct evidence supporting BV as a treatment for primary cutaneous T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma specifically."

The background information indicates that Brentuximab-vedotin (BV) has shown promising results in treating cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCLs), including Sezary syndrome (SS). The statement then describes a patient with Sezary syndrome who experienced ulceration of lymphomatous skin lesions while being treated with BV.

         While the statement does not explicitly claim that BV treats Sezary syndrome, it does suggest that BV is being used as a treatment for a patient with Sezary syndrome. Additionally, ulceration of lymphomatous skin lesions could be interpreted as a potential side effect of treatment rather than an absence of treatment efficacy. However, without further information about the patient's response to treatment, it is impossible to make definitive conclusions about BV's direct impact on Sezary syndrome in this specific case.

         It is important to note that while BV has shown promise in treating CTCLs like Sezary syndrome, more extensive clinical trials and studies would be required to definitively establish its safety and efficacy for treating Sezary"

        The statement suggests that there is a need for more studies on the use of brentuximab vedotin for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. This implies that while there may be some evidence suggesting its potential efficacy, it is not yet conclusive. Therefore, it does not support the claim that brentuximab vedotin definitively treats adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. 

        It is important to note that in medical and scientific contexts, definitive claims should be based on robust, conclusive evidence from well-designed studies. Preliminary or inconclusive evidence should be interpreted with caution and not used to make definitive claims."

        Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets CD30-positive lymphomas, which includes certain types of Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The statement acknowledges its effectiveness in treating these specific types of lymphomas, thereby implying that it indeed has therapeutic effects on lymphoma. However, it is essential to note that Brentuximab vedotin may not be effective for all lymphoma subtypes, as it specifically targets CD30-positive cells.

        In summary, while the statement does not explicitly confirm that Brentuximab vedotin treats all forms of lymphoma, it does provide indirect evidence supporting its efficacy in treating CD30-positive lymphomas, which is a significant subset of lymphoma types"

The interest in Brentuximab Vedotin (BV) for managing CD30-positive mycosis fungoides (MF) suggests its efficacy in treating this specific type of lymphoma. Mycosis fungoides is indeed a type of CD30-positive lymphoma; therefore, it can be inferred that BV may have potential therapeutic benefits for MF patients. However, it is essential to note that this interpretation is based on indirect evidence, and further investigation is required for more definitive conclusions regarding its direct application in treating MF."

The text mentions that tetracycline was one of the antimicrobials tested in epidemiological studies related to C.difficile infections. This implies that tetracycline was considered as a potential treatment option for these infections, thus providing indirect support for its antimicrobial properties and potential use in treating infections. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy in treating infections caused by C.difficile specifically, as the statement does not provide information on the outcomes of these tests."

The statement mentions that resistance to tetracycline among ocular surface infections is greater than 10%. This implies that tetracycline is still effective against these infections at least some of the time, otherwise there would be no need to mention its resistance specifically. Therefore, it can be inferred that tetracycline is used to treat eye infectious disorders, even if its effectiveness is being impacted by increasing resistance. However, it is important to note that direct evidence of tetracycline's effectiveness in treating eye infections would provide stronger support for the phrase in question."

        The title suggests that tetracycline (in its new hydrosoluble derivative form) is being considered for use in treating chronic osteomyelitis, which implies that tetracycline has potential therapeutic effects on osteomyelitis. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference based on the title alone. The actual study may provide more nuanced information that could alter this interpretation. For a more definitive conclusion, a full review of the study would be necessary."

A meta-analysis is a systematic review of multiple studies that uses statistical methods to combine their results. In this case, it specifically refers to studies involving local (topical) application of tetracycline for treating chronic periodontitis.

         The fact that such a meta-analysis was conducted indicates that there is enough evidence from individual studies suggesting that tetracycline may be effective in treating chronic periodontitis. While the statement does not explicitly confirm that tetracycline treats periodontitis, it does imply that there is some level of positive association between tetracycline use and improved periodontitis outcomes based on existing literature.

         However, it is essential to note that while indirect support exists, it does not definitively prove that tetracycline treats periodontitis. Further investigation is required to establish causality and determine factors such as optimal dosage, frequency of administration, potential side effects, and long-term efficacy."

The statement suggests that tetracycline is used in combination with ranitidine bismuth citrate and clarithromycin as part of a twice-a-day triple therapy for clarithromycin susceptible Helicobacter pylori infection. This implies that tetracycline is considered effective against Helicobacter pylori infection under certain conditions (i.e., when clarithromycin is susceptible). However, it is important to note that tetracycline is not being used alone in this treatment regimen, suggesting that it may not be effective as a standalone treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection."

         The statement suggests that alginate-based nanoemulsions have been found to be potentially effective in treating migraine pain, which is a type of pain. Therefore, it can be inferred that alginate could potentially treat pain, providing indirect support for the claim. However, it is important to note that this is an extrapolation of the original statement and further research would be needed to confirm this claim specifically for ""(Alginate)n treats Pain""."
11016107,(Alginate)n treats gastroesophageal reflux disease,1400,An open multicenter study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of alginic acid in two different dosages in 76 pediatric patients with gastroesophageal reflux confirmed by pH monitoring.,True,"'Does the phrase ""(Alginate)n treats gastroesophageal reflux disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""An open multicenter study was performed to assess the efficacy and safety of alginic acid in two different dosages in 76 pediatric patients with gastroesophageal reflux confirmed by pH monitoring.""?","Yes, indirectly it does lend some support. The statement mentions an open multicenter study that assesses the efficacy and safety of alginic acid in two different dosages in pediatric patients with gastroesophageal reflux confirmed by pH monitoring. Alginic acid is a type of alginate, hence if the study shows alginic acid to be effective in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), it could be inferred that alginate could potentially have similar effects. However, it is important to note that alginic acid is not necessarily equivalent to alginate in all its forms or applications. Therefore, while there is some indirect support, more specific studies focusing on ""(Alginate)n"" would be needed for stronger evidence."

The statement is expressing a need for more homogenous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with larger sample sizes to define the role of chlorhexidine (CHX) in non-surgical management of peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis. This implies that there is currently insufficient evidence to definitively establish CHX as an effective treatment for peri-implantitis based on existing studies. Therefore, it does not support the claim that chlorhexidine treats peri-implantitis."

The statement indicates that among patients without pneumonia at baseline, 24% developed pneumonia by day 3 when treated with chlorhexidine. This suggests that chlorhexidine may be associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in some cases, not that it treats pneumonia. It is important to distinguish between association (or correlation) and causation in interpreting such results."

The clinical trial investigates the impact of both sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine on mutans streptococci in children suffering from dental caries. The presence of chlorhexidine in the study suggests that it has some involvement in treating dental caries, even if not explicitly stated in isolation from sodium fluoride. However, it is crucial to note that chlorhexidine is not being presented as the sole treatment for dental caries in this study; rather it is one of two agents being tested in combination. Therefore, while there is some level of support for chlorhexidine treating dental caries based on this study, it is not presented as a standalone treatment."

The statement indicates that chlorhexidine was used to disinfect indwelling intravenous catheters in patients with B. stabilis bacteraemia, but it does not suggest that chlorhexidine was used as a treatment for bacterial infectious disease or sepsis itself. The misconception might arise from conflating the disinfection of medical equipment as a treatment for an infection in the patient; however, these two concepts should be distinguished in interpreting such evidence."
13955725,Chlorhexidine treats bacterial infectious disease,1405,Chlorhexidine (CHX) is effective in treating oral bacterial infections.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Chlorhexidine treats bacterial infectious disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Chlorhexidine (CHX) is effective in treating oral bacterial infections.""?","Yes, the statement ""Chlorhexidine (CHX) is effective in treating oral bacterial infections"" does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Chlorhexidine treats bacterial infectious disease"". This is because oral bacterial infections represent a subset of bacterial infectious diseases. If Chlorhexidine is shown to be effective in treating oral bacterial infections, it suggests that Chlorhexidine has some antimicrobial properties that could potentially be useful in treating other types of bacterial infections as well. However, it's important to note that this does not constitute direct evidence for Chlorhexidine's effectiveness in treating all types of bacterial infectious diseases. The specific efficacy would depend on various factors including the type of bacteria involved, the site of infection, and the dosage and formulation of Chlorhexidine used."

The conclusion statement mentions that prophylactic chlorhexidine (a type of antiseptic mouthwash) significantly improves both the frequency and duration of oral mucositis (OM), which is an inflammation of the mucous membrane in the mouth often referred to as stomatitis when it occurs in conjunction with cancer treatments.

         However, it is important to note that while stomatitis is a form of oral mucositis, not all oral mucositis is stomatitis. Therefore, while chlorhexidine can be said to treat stomatitis based on this evidence due to its effectiveness against oral mucositis (which includes stomatitis), further investigation into its specific effects on stomatitis would be necessary for a more direct correlation."
12567084,Chlorhexidine treats infectious disease,1407,"We developed an efficacious and non-irritant mouthwash that is alcohol-free and that has a low concentration of chlorhexidine, in order to be used for preventing oral cavity infections in immunocompromised and cancer patients.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Chlorhexidine treats infectious disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""We developed an efficacious and non-irritant mouthwash that is alcohol-free and that has a low concentration of chlorhexidine, in order to be used for preventing oral cavity infections in immunocompromised and cancer patients.""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Chlorhexidine treats infectious disease"". The development of an efficacious mouthwash containing chlorhexidine suggests that chlorhexidine has antimicrobial properties, which can be useful in treating and preventing infectious diseases. However, it is important to note that while chlorhexidine can help manage oral infections in immunocompromised and cancer patients as suggested by the statement, it does not necessarily mean that chlorhexidine can treat all types of infectious diseases. The effectiveness of chlorhexidine depends on various factors such as concentration, duration of exposure, and specific pathogens involved in the infectious disease."
12447822,Chlorhexidine treats Neonatal sepsis,1408,"However, 2 large but not randomized studies, one in Malawi and the other in Egypt, suggest that important reductions in maternal and neonatal sepsis and neonatal mortality may be achievable with vaginal or neonatal chlorhexidine treatment.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Chlorhexidine treats Neonatal sepsis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""However, 2 large but not randomized studies, one in Malawi and the other in Egypt, suggest that important reductions in maternal and neonatal sepsis and neonatal mortality may be achievable with vaginal or neonatal chlorhexidine treatment.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement provided. The claim made in the statement is not an explicit endorsement of chlorhexidine as a treatment for neonatal sepsis; rather, it suggests that there is potential for significant reductions in maternal and neonatal sepsis as well as neonatal mortality when using vaginal or neonatal chlorhexidine treatment.

         The key term here is ""may be achievable,"" which implies that further investigation is required before definitive conclusions can be drawn about chlorhexidine as an effective treatment for neonatal sepsis. However, given that sepsis is often associated with high mortality rates in neonates, any intervention that shows promise in reducing its incidence is worth noting.

         It is important to highlight that these studies were not randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are generally considered the gold standard for clinical trials due to their ability to minimize bias and confounding factors. Therefore, while these findings suggest promising avenues for future research, they do not provide conclusive evidence of chlorhexidine's efficacy in treating neonatal sepsis."

The provided background information discusses tooth staining as a side effect of chlorhexidine treatment for periodontal disease, but it does not imply that chlorhexidine is an effective treatment for periodontal disorder. In fact, it suggests that there is variability in tooth staining among patients undergoing chlorhexidine treatment for periodontal disease, which may be indicative of varying responses to treatment rather than treatment efficacy itself.

         To provide indirect support for ""Chlorhexidine treats periodontal disorder,"" there would need to be some evidence suggesting that chlorhexidine use leads to improvements in periodontal health outcomes. The background statement only addresses tooth staining as an adverse effect of treatment, not its therapeutic benefits for periodontal disease."

This is because it indicates that chlorhexidine has been studied in relation to ocular infections in a clinical trial setting. However, it does not provide direct evidence of its efficacy as it does not specify the outcomes of the trial or whether chlorhexidine was found to be effective in treating these infections. Therefore, further investigation would be necessary to confirm whether chlorhexidine indeed treats eye infectious disorders."

The statement suggests that an abrasive property of a chew is primarily responsible for maintaining oral health in dogs with mild gingivitis, rather than chlorhexidine's antibacterial activity. This implies that chlorhexidine may not be the primary factor in treating gingivitis in dogs, which contradicts the phrase ""Chlorhexidine treats gingivitis."""

This is because it implies that there is an ongoing investigation into whether chlorhexidine can be used as a local treatment for periodontitis, which suggests that there is some basis for believing that chlorhexidine may have therapeutic effects in treating periodontitis. However, it is important to note that this does not constitute direct evidence for the efficacy of chlorhexidine in treating periodontitis, as further studies would be needed to establish its effectiveness conclusively."

         Indirect support is provided because the statement explicitly mentions chlorhexidine being used in the treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis, which implies that chlorhexidine has some efficacy against this condition. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy. The statement does not provide information on the treatment outcome, dosage used, potential side effects, or comparative analysis against other treatments. Therefore, further investigation would be necessary to establish chlorhexidine as an evidence-based treatment for Acanthamoeba keratitis."

The Okayama Depression and Apathy Project (ODAP) study investigates the efficacy of Sertraline, Escitalopram, and Nicergoline in treating depression and apathy in Alzheimer's disease patients. The fact that Nicergoline is included in this study implies that it has potential therapeutic effects on depressive symptoms associated with Alzheimer's disease.

        However, it is important to note that the statement does not explicitly confirm that Nicergoline treats depressive disorder in all cases; rather it suggests that Nicergoline may be helpful in addressing depressive symptoms in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Further investigation would be required to determine its efficacy in other populations and contexts.

        Additionally, while Nicergoline may have some positive impact on depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease patients, it is not necessarily the primary mechanism of action for Nicergoline; it could be that its effects on apathy or other neuropsychiatric symptoms indirectly influence depressive symptoms as well.

The objectives of the study explicitly mention determining evidence of efficacy of nicergoline in the treatment of dementia, which suggests that there is an expectation that nicergoline could have a positive effect on dementia symptoms. However, it is important to note that these objectives do not confirm that nicergoline treats dementia definitively; they only indicate that a study is being conducted to investigate this possibility. The results of that study would need to be evaluated separately in order to make any definitive conclusions about nicergoline's efficacy in treating dementia."

The study involves treating patients diagnosed with either metastatic gastric cancer or adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) using ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel as second-line or beyond second-line therapy. Adenocarcinoma is a specific type of gastric cancer; therefore, it can be inferred that ramucirumab is indeed used in treating adenocarcinoma in this context. However, it is essential to note that the statement does not explicitly claim that ramucirumab treats adenocarcinoma as a single agent; it is used in combination therapy in these cases.

         To further support this claim, one could look at existing literature on ramucirumab as monotherapy for adenocarcinoma treatment. For instance, in the REGARD trial (Fuchs et al., 2014), ramucirumab monotherapy demonstrated improved overall survival in patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma following first-line chemotherapy compared to placebo"

The study aims to validate the use of ramucirumab in combination with docetaxel and pegfilgrastim for primary prophylaxis in Japanese patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). This implies that ramucirumab is being used as part of a treatment regimen for NSCLC, thus lending indirect support to the claim that ramucirumab treats non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, it is important to note that direct support would require specific efficacy data linking ramucirumab treatment to improved outcomes in NSCLC patients, which is not provided in the statement."

The title suggests that ramucirumab is being analyzed for its cost-effectiveness in treating hepatocellular carcinoma patients who have progressed on sorafenib therapy and have alpha-fetoprotein concentrations of at least 400 ng/ml. The fact that an analysis is being conducted implies that there is some basis for considering ramucirumab as a potential treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma in this specific patient population.

        However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy. A cost-effectiveness analysis is an economic evaluation that compares the relative costs and outcomes of different interventions but does not provide direct evidence of therapeutic benefits. Therefore, further clinical evidence would be required to substantiate the claim that ""RAMUCIRUMAB treats hepatocellular carcinoma.""

        In summary, while the statement provides some level of indirect support for the consideration of ramucirumab as a treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma in specific patients, it does not constitute definitive evidence"

The statement indicates that lenalidomide was approved in combination with tafasitamab for patients with relapsed DLBCL after 1 to 3 previous treatments. This implies that tafasitamab is an active component in treating DLBCL, even though it is used in combination with lenalidomide. However, it is important to note that the statement does not provide direct evidence of tafasitamab's efficacy as a single agent in treating DLBCL. It only supports its use in combination therapy for relapsed DLBCL patients who have had previous treatments."

The conclusion of the study indicates that thioctic acid (also known as alpha-lipoic acid) supplementation after acute optic neuritis is safe and well-tolerated; however, it does not provide evidence for its neuroprotective effects due to insufficient recruitment. Therefore, while thioctic acid may be safe for use in such cases, there is no evidence presented that it can effectively treat optic neuritis."

Thioctic acid is also known as alpha-lipoic acid; they are two names for the same compound. Therefore, if alpha-lipoic acid is an effective treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome, then thioctic acid would be as well, since they are one and the same. However, it is important to note that more direct evidence specifically linking thioctic acid to carpal tunnel syndrome treatment would strengthen this conclusion."

Thioctic acid is also known as alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), which is an antioxidant that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism in the body. ALA has been found to have anti-inflammatory properties and can act as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist. PPAR-gamma agonists have been studied for their potential therapeutic effects in treating various inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

        However, it is essential to note that while there is some evidence suggesting that ALA may help alleviate symptoms of certain skin disorders due to its anti-inflammatory properties and PPAR-gamma agonist activity, more rigorous clinical trials are needed to establish its efficacy as a treatment for specific skin conditions conclusively. Additionally, thioctic acid is just one of many compounds that can act as an ALA-based PPAR-gamma agonist; therefore,"

Group 1 received alpha-lipoic acid (thioctic acid), while group 2 received a complex of antioxidants and neuroprotectors that included thioctic acid among other substances.

         However, there is no mention of any specific results regarding improvements in MS symptoms for either group after receiving their respective treatments. Without evidence of an association between thioctic acid treatment and improvements in MS symptoms, it is not possible to infer that thioctic acid can be used as a treatment for MS.

Thioctic acid is another name for alpha-lipoic acid, but the statement only suggests that it might be a successful neuroprotective therapy option for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias, not that it treats AD. The study was small and not randomized, which means that the results should be interpreted with caution and do not provide definitive evidence of a treatment effect. Furthermore, the term ""neuroprotective"" implies that alpha-lipoic acid may help protect neurons from damage rather than treating the disease itself. Therefore, more rigorous studies are needed before claiming that thioctic acid treats Alzheimer disease."

The statement suggests that alpha-lipoic acid treatment (also known as thioctic acid) partially improved increased blood pressure in rats with STZ-diabetes. However, it is important to note that this study was conducted in an animal model of diabetes (STZ-diabetes), not specifically in hypertensive disorder models. Therefore, while it provides some evidence for the potential blood pressure lowering effects of thioctic acid, it does not directly support the claim that thioctic acid treats hypertensive disorder in humans.

The reason is that if ampicillin were not effective in treating bacterial infections, it would not be used in combination with other antibiotics for empiric treatment of neonatal bacterial infections as mentioned in the statement. However, it is important to note that ampicillin is usually used in combination with other antibiotics because many bacterial infections are caused by multiple types of bacteria, some of which may be resistant to ampicillin. Therefore, while ampicillin does have therapeutic effects on certain bacterial infections, it may not be effective for all types of bacterial infections when used alone."

The statement indicates that animals treated locally with microencapsulated ampicillin (a form of ampicillin) and those that received parenteral ampicillin therapy (direct administration of ampicillin into the body) had lower rates of osteomyelitis when antibiotic therapy was not delayed. This suggests that ampicillin could potentially be effective in treating osteomyelitis when administered promptly and appropriately.

The study mentions that ampicillin (AMPC), in combination with other beta-lactams, was validated in systemic infections in mice. Sepsis is essentially a severe systemic inflammatory response caused by an infection, which can be treated using appropriate antibiotics such as ampicillin when the causative agent is susceptible. However, it is important to note that sepsis treatment usually involves combinations of antibiotics depending on the specific infection and patient condition; therefore, one should not infer that ampicillin alone is sufficient for treating sepsis based solely on this statement."

In fact, it suggests that ampicillin (and penicillin) may not be effective in treating bacterial meningitis (BM), as there is no observed decrease in mortality rate among those treated with these antibiotics over the past 30 years in Spain. This implies that alternative treatments might be more successful in managing BM. Nonetheless, further investigation is required to draw definitive conclusions about ampicillin's efficacy in treating bacterial meningitis since other factors (such as bacterial resistance, dosage, duration of treatment, etc.) may influence treatment outcomes."

This is because assuming a prominent role in treatment implies that the drug is effective against the disease to some degree. However, it is important to note that ""treats"" is somewhat ambiguous - it could mean anything from significantly alleviating symptoms to completely curing the disease. Therefore, while there is support for the idea that ampicillin has some effect on gonorrhea, more specific information would be needed to determine the exact nature and extent of this effect."

The title of the study suggests that ampicillin, when combined with sulbactam, was compared to cefotiam in treating pneumonia in elderly patients. This implies that ampicillin was used in an attempt to treat pneumonia, thus providing indirect evidence that ampicillin can be used for treating pneumonia. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of ampicillin in treating pneumonia may depend on various factors such as the type of pneumonia (e.g., community-acquired vs hospital-acquired), the patient's overall health status, potential allergies or side effects, and whether the bacteria causing the pneumonia is susceptible to ampicillin. Therefore, while the statement provides some support for the use of ampicillin in treating pneumonia, it does not necessarily confirm its overall efficacy in all cases of pneumonia."

The statement provided indicates that carbenicillin was used in combination with amikacin as a treatment option for invasive bacterial infections in newborn infants in a study where it was compared against ceftazidime. The fact that it was used in such a context suggests that carbenicillin does have some therapeutic effect on bacterial infections, even though in this specific study it was not as effective as ceftazidime.

         However, it is important to note that antibiotics like carbenicillin only treat bacterial infections; they have no effect on viral infections. Also, antibiotic resistance is an increasing concern in modern medicine, so while antibiotics like carbenicillin can be effective in treating bacterial infections, they should be used judiciously and appropriately based on culture results and susceptibility testing whenever possible."

This is because conducting a clinical trial of a drug in a specific context (in this case, acute bacterial infections) implies that there is some underlying rationale for believing that the drug may be effective in treating that condition. In other words, if there were no basis for believing that bacampicillin could treat bacterial infections, it would not make sense to conduct such a trial.

         However, it is important to note that while this statement provides indirect support for the claim that bacampicillin treats bacterial infections, it does not constitute direct evidence. The fact that a clinical trial was conducted does not necessarily mean that the drug was found to be effective in that trial; it only suggests that there was some reason to believe it might be before the trial began. To fully evaluate the claim that bacampicillin treats bacterial infections, one would need to examine the results of that clinical trial (or ideally, multiple trials) in detail.

         The statement implies that Aspoxicillin (ASPC) has been found useful in treating bacterial infections in pediatric patients. This suggests that Aspoxicillin has antibacterial properties that can help manage bacterial infectious diseases in children. However, it is important to note that direct evidence of Aspoxicillin treating bacterial infections is not provided in this statement; therefore, it only lends indirect support for the claim in question.

         Additionally, it is crucial that any conclusions drawn from such statements be based on rigorous scientific evaluation of evidence from well-designed studies published in reputable journals. The context of the statement, including details about the study design, sample size, statistical analysis, and potential conflicts of interest should also be taken into account when interpreting its implications for clinical practice."

The statement mentions an open multicentre study conducted in Germany to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of sulbactam combined with mezlocillin in severe bacterial infections. This implies that mezlocillin was used as a treatment for bacterial infections in this study, providing indirect evidence for its use in treating such diseases. However, it is important to note that while this suggests its potential therapeutic value, it does not constitute direct evidence of its efficacy as a standalone treatment for bacterial infections without sulbactam."

         The statement lists various treatments for acne, one of which is benzoyl peroxide. This implies that benzoyl peroxide is recognized as an effective treatment for acne in the medical community. Therefore, it indirectly supports the claim that benzoyl peroxide treats acne by including it in a list of recognized treatments for acne.

         However, it is important to note that while benzoyl peroxide is recognized as an acne treatment, it may not be effective for all types of acne or all individuals. The effectiveness of benzoyl peroxide as an acne treatment can depend on various factors such as the severity of acne, individual skin type, potential side effects, and how it is used in combination with other treatments."
26328908,Proglumide treats peptic ulcer disease,1442,[Controlled and double-blind study of the treatment of peptic ulcer with cimetidine and proglumide].,True,"'Does the phrase ""Proglumide treats peptic ulcer disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""[Controlled and double-blind study of the treatment of peptic ulcer with cimetidine and proglumide].""?","Yes, the statement does provide indirect support for the claim that ""Proglumide treats peptic ulcer disease."" The study mentioned is controlled and double-blind, which suggests that it is methodologically sound and capable of providing valuable insights into the efficacy of the treatments being studied - in this case, cimetidine and proglumide.

        
        However, it is important to note that the statement does not explicitly confirm that proglumide treats peptic ulcer disease; rather, it implies that proglumide is being studied in relation to peptic ulcer treatment. To definitively support the claim that proglumide treats peptic ulcer disease, one would need access to additional information from the study such as whether proglumide was found to be significantly more effective than a placebo in treating peptic ulcers, whether there were any adverse effects associated with its use, etc.

        
        In conclusion, while the statement does provide some level of indirect support for the claim that proglumide treats peptic ulcer disease, it is not sufficient on its own to confirm that proglumide is an effective treatment for peptic ulcers without further information from the"

         The key term here is ""alternative,"" which implies that Pirenzepine is one of the treatments for GERD. The statement also mentions that it could be beneficial for some patients who have not responded well to other therapies (refractory), suggesting that Pirenzepine has therapeutic potential for GERD management. However, it is important to note that this is indirect evidence, as it does not explicitly state that Pirenzepine treats GERD but rather implies it through its suggested use as an alternative treatment option for GERD patients.

         For more definitive evidence on Pirenzepine treating GERD, clinical trials and studies should be consulted where Pirenzepine is compared against placebo or other standard treatments for GERD in order to establish its efficacy in treating GERD conclus"

        The statement provides evidence that magnesium oxide can reduce CIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) in PXE (pseudoxanthoma elasticum) mice, which is a potential indicator for disease prevention in PXE patients. However, autosomal recessive inherited pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a genetic condition caused by mutations in specific genes (ABCC6 being one of them). The statement does not provide any information about magnesium oxide correcting these genetic mutations or treating the autosomal recessive inherited nature of PXE. Therefore, it does not indirectly support magnesium oxide as a treatment for autosomal recessive inherited pseudoxanthoma elasticum but rather as a potential preventative measure for reducing CIMT in PXE"

The statement describes a case where long-term ingestion of magnesium oxide cathartics (a type of laxative) led to a rectal obstruction due to a pharmacobezoar (a mass of undissolved drug in the intestines). This suggests that magnesium oxide did have an effect on the woman's gastrointestinal system, indicating its use as a treatment for constipation. However, it's important to note that this is one case study and doesn't necessarily prove that magnesium oxide is an effective treatment for all cases of constipation disorder. Adverse effects such as rectal obstruction can occur with long-term use, which should be taken into consideration when evaluating its use as a treatment."

The statement ""Mezlocillin and ticarcillin in the treatment of patients with serious systemic infections"" suggests that both Mezlocillin and Ticarcillin are used in treating severe infections, which can include Sepsis. However, it doesn't explicitly state that Ticarcillin treats Sepsis. Sepsis is indeed a serious systemic infection, so the use of Ticarcillin in its treatment can be inferred, but it is not directly stated in the provided context. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, it is not unequivocal."

This is because osteomyelitis is a type of bone infection, and Pseudomonas species are known to cause such infections. Therefore, if there is evidence suggesting that ticarcillin has some beneficial effect on bone infections caused by Pseudomonas species, it can be inferred that ticarcillin could potentially be used to treat osteomyelitis caused by these species. However, it is important to note that this inference is based on indirect evidence, and further investigation would be required to confirm the efficacy of ticarcillin in treating osteomyelitis caused by Pseudomonas species specifically. Additionally, unbalanced comparative studies have inherent limitations, such as potential confounding factors and bias, which could influence the observed effect. Therefore, while there is some support for the claim, it is not definitive proof that ticarcillin should be used to treat osteomy"

The statement discusses the administration of benzoate in both normal subjects and patients with citrullinemia, noting that there was no significant increase in precursors of urea (ammonia, glutamate, glutamine, and alpha-amino nitrogen). However, it does not mention urea administration nor its effects on citrullinemia patients. To provide indirect support for ""Urea treats citrullinemia,"" there should be some indication that urea has beneficial effects on citrullinemia patients in particular or related metabolic processes; however, such evidence is absent in this statement."

The statement suggests that there is a relationship between urea formation and argininosuccinate in a patient with argininosuccinic aciduria when studied using labelled precursors. This implies that urea might play some role in managing argininosuccinic aciduria, which aligns with the claim that urea can treat argininosuccinic aciduria. However, it is important to note that this does not provide direct evidence of treatment efficacy; further studies would be needed to establish that."

The statement lists ""radiation induced dermatitis"" as one of the conditions that has been effectively treated with urea. Radiodermatitis is a type of dermatitis that results from exposure to radiation, often in the context of cancer treatment. Therefore, the statement suggests that urea could be an effective treatment for radiodermatitis. However, it is important to note that this is indirect support based on a single statement, and further evidence would be needed to confirm this claim."

         The rationale behind this indirect support stems from our understanding of TRPV1 receptors as key mediators of pain signaling in the nervous system (Caterina et al., 1997). Antagonizing these receptors has been shown to reduce pain sensitivity in various models of pain (Julius & Basbaum, 2001). Therefore, identifying novel urea-based compounds that act"

This is because neurotrophic skin diseases constitute a type of skin disorder. Urea's therapeutic application in treating such diseases implies that it has beneficial effects on skin health under certain conditions, thus lending credence to the broader claim that urea can be used in treating skin disorders. However, it is important to note that neurotrophic skin diseases represent only a specific subset of skin disorders; therefore, further investigation would be required to establish whether urea is effective for other types of skin conditions as well."

The statement discusses a preliminary note on the oral treatment of diabetes using N-sulfonyl-p-methylbenzene-N'-n-butyl urea (D 860), which is different from urea. Urea is a waste product that is not typically associated with direct therapeutic benefits for diabetes mellitus. Therefore, without additional evidence linking urea specifically to diabetes treatment, one cannot infer that urea is an effective treatment for diabetes based on this statement about D 860."

The statement mentions that mannitol is used in hyperosmolar blood-brain barrier disruption (HBBBD) for treating brain tumors by increasing drug delivery to tumor and adjacent brain tissues. This implies that mannitol might have some therapeutic effect in treating brain cancer, although it does not explicitly say that mannitol treats brain cancer on its own. Instead, it suggests that mannitol could be an adjunct therapy in enhancing drug delivery for brain cancer treatment. However, it is important to note that more direct evidence would be needed to definitively claim that mannitol treats brain cancer independently of other drugs."

Use in the treatment of deafness"" does provide indirect support for the phrase ""Mannitol treats hearing loss disorder"". The use of mannitol in treating deafness implies that it has some sort of positive effect on hearing loss disorders, which aligns with the general idea conveyed by ""Mannitol treats hearing loss disorder"". However, it is important to note that direct support would require more specific evidence linking mannitol administration to improvements in hearing loss disorders in controlled studies. The term ""treats"" can be interpreted in different ways, so further investigation would be necessary for a definitive conclusion."

The statement indicates that there is an ongoing study on the efficacy and safety of intra-articular injection of 2% sodium hyaluronate plus 0.5% mannitol in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The fact that mannitol is included in the study suggests that it may have some therapeutic potential in treating osteoarthritis, at least when used in conjunction with sodium hyaluronate. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect inference and the actual results of the study are needed to make any definitive conclusions about the efficacy of mannitol in treating osteoarthritis."

The correlation between mannitol therapy and hypotension suggests that mannitol may have an impact on blood pressure regulation. However, it is important to note that correlation does not imply causation, so further investigation would be necessary to establish whether mannitol is treating hypotension or if there is another explanation for this observed correlation. Additionally, the statement does not provide information about the direction of effect (i.e., whether mannitol therapy leads to decreased hypotension), which is crucial for understanding its potential therapeutic value in treating hypotensive disorder."

In fact, it suggests that mannitol was ineffective in treating pain and intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in this particular case. The statement lists several treatments that were tried, including intravenous mannitol, which all failed to control relapsing pain and IOP elevation. This implies that mannitol did not alleviate the pain symptoms in this instance, thus not supporting the claim that mannitol treats pain.

        However, it is important to note that this evidence is derived from a single case study, which has limited power in establishing generalized conclusions about mannitol's effectiveness in pain treatment due to factors such as individual variability in response to treatments and potential confounding factors in the study design. Further research involving larger sample sizes, controlled experiments, and robust study designs would be required to make definitive conclusions about mannitol's efficacy in treating pain."

This is because improved cerebral perfusion can potentially lead to better outcomes in patients with brain injury by ensuring adequate blood flow and oxygen supply to the brain tissue. However, it is important to note that this does not directly confirm that mannitol treats brain injury as further research would be needed to establish causality and efficacy in treating brain injury specifically."

The conclusion of the study suggests that mannitol may be useful as a predictor for ICS (Inhaled Corticosteroid) responsiveness in mild to moderately severe COPD patients based on AHR (Airway Hyperresponsiveness) to mannitol. However, it does not imply that mannitol is a treatment for COPD. The study is investigating mannitol as a potential predictive marker for ICS responsiveness in COPD patients, not as a treatment for COPD itself."

This is because mannitol is mentioned in conjunction with acute renal failure (also known as acute kidney injury), implying its use as a treatment. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy. A thorough evaluation of clinical trials and peer-reviewed studies is necessary to establish the therapeutic value of mannitol in treating acute kidney failure."

This is because ischemic injury is a type of injury characterized by insufficient blood supply to an organ or tissue, such as in stroke or trauma situations. Mannitol, as an osmotic diuretic, can help reduce brain swelling by drawing water out of brain cells, thereby potentially mitigating ischemic injury consequences.

         However, it is important to note that while this statement supports mannitol's potential therapeutic effect on ischemic injury in rats following a specific type of insult (short-duration forebrain ischemic), it does not necessarily mean that mannitol will be equally effective in treating all types of injuries in different organisms (including humans). Further investigation is required to establish mannitol's efficacy in various injury models and its underlying mechanisms of action in order to make more definitive conclusions about its therapeutic potential in treating injuries in general."

The statement suggests that IV mannitol is considered the treatment of choice for CP by medical professionals, even though it has not been evaluated in a double-blind randomized trial. This implies that there is some consensus in the medical community regarding mannitol's efficacy in treating CP based on observational studies, case reports, or other forms of evidence. However, it is important to note that without results from a rigorous double-blind randomized trial, the level of evidence supporting mannitol as an effective treatment for CP is still limited."

        The statement only suggests that mannitol has an effect on EEG recordings in stroke patients. It does not necessarily imply that these effects are therapeutic or beneficial for treating stroke disorders. Furthermore, even if mannitol were shown to have some effect on EEG recordings in stroke patients, this would not be sufficient evidence to conclude that it treats stroke disorder, as further studies would be needed to establish such a link. Therefore, without additional information linking mannitol's effects on EEG recordings to improved stroke outcomes, one cannot infer that mannitol treats stroke disorder based on this statement alone."

This is because improved mucus clearance is generally associated with better disease outcomes in bronchiectasis patients, suggesting that mannitol could potentially have therapeutic benefits for treating bronchiectasis. However, it is important to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive proof of efficacy. A more robust evaluation of mannitol as a treatment for bronchiectasis would require controlled clinical trials assessing clinically relevant endpoints such as exacerbation rates, lung function decline, and quality of life measures."
8007841,"Mannitol treats chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1 positive",1473,Treatment of chronic myelocytic leukaemia with dibromo-mannitol (myelobromol).,False,"'Does the phrase ""Mannitol treats chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1 positive"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Treatment of chronic myelocytic leukaemia with dibromo-mannitol (myelobromol).""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the claim that ""Mannitol treats chronic myelogenous leukemia, BCR-ABL1 positive."" The statement mentions dibromo-mannitol (myelobromol), which is different from mannitol alone in its chemical structure and properties due to the addition of bromine atoms. The effects of dibromo-mannitol on chronic myelocytic leukemia cannot be generalized to mannitol without further evidence specifically investigating mannitol's impact on chronic myelogenous leukemia (BCR-ABL1 positive).

        To further elaborate on why there is no indirect support for this claim, let us consider some aspects of mannitol and dibromo-mannitol (myelobromol). Mannitol is a type of sugar alcohol used primarily as a diuretic, sweetener, and in medical applications as an osmotic agent for reducing intracranial pressure. Dibromo-mannitol (myelobromol), on the other hand, is an experimental compound that has been studied in limited contexts for its potential anticancer"
7780960,Mannitol treats cystic fibrosis,1474,Inhaled mannitol is a potential mucoactive agent in cystic fibrosis patients.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Mannitol treats cystic fibrosis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Inhaled mannitol is a potential mucoactive agent in cystic fibrosis patients.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement ""Inhaled mannitol is a potential mucoactive agent in cystic fibrosis patients."" 

        Mannitol is identified as a potential mucoactive agent in this context, which implies its potential therapeutic use in cystic fibrosis. Mucoactive agents aim to modify mucus properties, enhancing its clearance from the airways, thereby alleviating symptoms associated with cystic fibrosis. Although the statement does not explicitly confirm that mannitol treats cystic fibrosis, it does suggest that mannitol could play a positive role in managing the disease by acting on mucus clearance.

        However, it is essential to note that indirect support does not equate to definitive evidence of treatment efficacy. Further investigation through rigorous clinical trials is necessary to establish mannitol as an effective treatment for cystic fibrosis."

The conclusion states that hypertonic saline is as effective as mannitol in treating intracranial hypertension associated with ICH (Intracerebral Hemorrhage). This implies that mannitol is indeed effective in treating intracranial hypertension, as it is being compared to another effective treatment (hypertonic saline) in terms of efficacy. However, it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily mean mannitol is superior or preferred over other treatments, but rather that it has demonstrated efficacy in treating intracranial hypertension."

The statement suggests that temocillin is being investigated for its potential non-inferiority compared to carbapenems in treating bacteraemia caused by 3GCR-E bacteria. Bacteraemia is a type of bacterial infection that can lead to sepsis if not treated promptly and effectively. Therefore, if temocillin is found to be non-inferior to carbapenems in treating bacteraemia due to 3GCR-E, it could be inferred that temocillin is effective in treating bacterial infections associated with sepsis. However, it's important to note that this is an indirect inference and the direct claim being investigated in the statement is about bacteraemia caused by specific bacteria, not sepsis in general."

The conclusion suggests that artesunate (which is derived from artesunic acid) has potential therapeutic benefits for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, it is important to note that ""treats"" is a strong word that implies direct causality and complete resolution of the disease state, which may not be fully supported by the conclusion provided. The conclusion only suggests that artesunate could offer a new approach to therapy, implying further investigation is needed before definitive statements about treatment can be made."

This is because artesunate is a derivative of artemisinin, which is found in the plant Artemisia annua L., also known as sweet wormwood. Artemisinin and its derivatives, including artesunate, have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries to treat various conditions, including gastrointestinal disorders.

         The statement implies that there is evidence suggesting artesunate as a potential therapy for Crohn's disease, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). While it does not explicitly state that artesunic acid treats Crohn disease, it suggests that artesunate may have therapeutic benefits for Crohn's disease patients. This inference is based on the premise that artesunate and artesunic acid share similar chemical structures and potentially overlapping biological activities due to their common origin in artemisinin.

In fact, it suggests quite the opposite - that artesunic acid (also known as artesunate) may induce resistance in highly metastatic breast tumors. This could imply that artesunic acid might not be an effective treatment for breast neoplasm (i.e., breast cancer), but rather could potentially exacerbate the disease by promoting resistance in aggressive tumors.

         The statement comes from an in vitro (i.e., laboratory experiments using cells) and in vivo (i.e., experiments using live animals) study investigating the effects of artesunic acid on breast tumors. The researchers found that artesunic acid treatment led to resistance in highly metastatic breast tumors, which is not indicative of a therapeutic effect but rather suggests that artesunic acid may have detrimental consequences in treating breast cancer.

The key point here is that artesunate was used as a treatment for cytomegalovirus infection in a patient who had developed resistance to other conventional treatments (foscarnet and ganciclovir). This suggests that artesunate may have some efficacy against cytomegalovirus infections, at least in cases where other treatments have failed. However, it is important to note that this is based on a single case report and further studies would be needed to confirm these findings and establish the safety and efficacy of artesunate for this indication."

The statement ""The anticancer activity of artesunate has also been shown in human xenograft tumors in mice"" suggests that artesunate, which is a derivative of artesunic acid, has demonstrated anticancer effects in preclinical studies using mouse models of human cancer (human xenograft tumors). This implies that artesunic acid might also have similar anticancer properties since it is structurally related to artesunate. However, it is important to note that these findings from preclinical studies do not necessarily translate into similar effects in humans; thus further clinical studies in humans would be required for more definitive evidence of artesunic acid's anticancer activity in humans (neoplasm)."

The conclusion mentions oral artesunate as part of an effective strategy for controlling schistosomiasis in lake regions. Artesunic acid is a derivative of artesunate, sharing similar biological properties and mechanisms of action. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that if artesunate is effective in treating schistosomiasis, then artesunic acid may also have similar therapeutic potential against this disease. However, it is important to note that direct evidence specifically linking artesunic acid to treating schistosomiasis would provide stronger support for such a claim."

The study mentions artesunate, which is a derivative of artesunic acid, as part of its treatment for Schistosoma haematobium infections. Schistosoma haematobium is known to cause urinary schistosomiasis; therefore, if artesunate is effective in treating these infections, it suggests that artesunic acid may also have similar therapeutic properties against urinary schistosomiasis due to their close chemical relationship. However, it is important to note that artesunic acid has not been explicitly studied in relation to urinary schistosomiasis; thus, further investigation is required for a definitive conclusion."

Artemether and artesunate are derivatives of artemisinin, which is also the primary component of artesunic acid. These compounds share similar mechanisms of action in treating malaria by targeting the malaria parasite's erythrocytic stages.

         The statement highlights that artemether and artesunate have shown promising results in treating severe malaria when administered rectally. Although it does not explicitly mention artesunic acid, their shared origin from artemisinin suggests that artesunic acid may also have therapeutic potential against malaria.

         However, it is essential to note that direct evidence of artesunic acid's efficacy in treating malaria should be sought from clinical trials and experimental studies specifically investigating artesunic acid as an antimalarial agent.

Artesunic acid is a prodrug that gets rapidly converted into dihydroartemisinin upon administration in vivo. Dihydroartemisinin is an active metabolite responsible for most of artesunic acid's antimalarial effects. The statement mentions declining concentrations of dihydroartemisinin in plasma during 5-day oral treatment with artesunate for Falciparum malaria. This implies that artesunic acid is being metabolized into dihydroartemisinin, which is subsequently reducing Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia. Therefore, it suggests that artesunic acid does indeed treat Plasmodium falciparum malaria by being metabolized into dihydroartemisinin in vivo.

        
        However, it is important to note that direct causality cannot be established solely based on this statement as it does not explicitly demonstrate that artesunic acid reduces Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in patients.

The statement compares the efficacy of artemether and quinine in treating severe malaria, suggesting that artemether is at least as effective as quinine, if not more so. This implies that artemether can indeed treat malaria, as quinine is already an established treatment for the disease. Furthermore, the recognition of quinine resistance in certain regions strengthens the argument for artemether as a viable alternative treatment for malaria in those areas where quinine resistance is prevalent. However, it is important to note that while this statement provides some level of support for artemether as an effective treatment for malaria, it does not constitute definitive proof of its efficacy in all cases of malaria infection.

The statement mentions artemisinin and artemether as part of the recent broadening of the treatment spectrum for falciparum malaria. This implies that these drugs are used in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria, which is consistent with the claim that artemether treats Plasmodium falciparum malaria. However, it's important to note that indirect support is not as strong as direct evidence, and for a more definitive conclusion, direct clinical trial evidence or mechanistic studies demonstrating artemether's efficacy against Plasmodium falciparum would be required."

        Isoproterenol, also known as isoprenaline, is a medication used in treating obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It works by relaxing muscles in the airways and increasing airflow to the lungs, thereby alleviating symptoms of obstructive lung diseases (National Library of Medicine, n.d.).

        

        The statement in question refers to an investigation of isoprenaline resistance in patients with obstructive lung disease. Resistance to isoprenaline implies that patients have become less responsive to its therapeutic effects over time (Barnes, 2000). This investigation suggests that isoproterenol has been previously used for treating obstructive lung disease patients, as resistance implies prior exposure.

         The original statement suggests that obese individuals have a decreased responsiveness to isoproterenol, implying that isoproterenol may not be an effective treatment for obesity. This is in contrast to the claim that isoproterenol treats obesity disorder. The statement actually suggests that if isoproterenol were to be used as a treatment for obesity, it might be less effective in obese individuals due to these defects downstream of adenylyl cyclase activation of cyclic AMP.

The statement suggests that bacitracin, in combination with gramicidin S, can be used in an ointment formulation for bacterial infection control. This implies that bacitracin has antibacterial properties that contribute to its effectiveness in treating bacterial infections when used in conjunction with gramicidin S in nanopeptide ribbon formulation. However, it is important to note that the claim does not specify which type of bacitracin (A, B, or Z) is being referred to; therefore, it provides indirect support for bacitracin A in particular.

         Additionally, it should be emphasized that while there is some support for bacitracin A's antibacterial properties based on the provided statement, further investigation is required for more direct evidence of its ability to treat bacterial infectious diseases specifically. This could include clinical trials, in vitro studies, or other forms of experimental evidence that demonstrate bacitracin A's efficacy in treating bacterial infections in living organisms."

The statement lists Bacitracin as one of the recommended topical treatments for facial burns, which implies that it has some efficacy in treating burns. However, it's important to note that the statement does not provide direct evidence of Bacitracin's effectiveness in treating burns, as it does not mention any specific studies or clinical trials that support its use. Furthermore, the statement suggests that Bacitracin is used specifically for facial burns, so it may not be applicable to all types of burns. Therefore, while the statement does lend some support to the claim, it does not conclusively prove that Bacitracin A treats burns."

        Fenbendazole is an anthelmintic drug used to treat various parasitic worm infestations in animals, including helminthiasis. The statement given discusses ranolazine, a medication used to treat chronic angina by reducing ischemia (lack of blood flow/oxygen) in heart muscle tissue. The two statements discuss different drugs acting through different mechanisms; therefore, there is no connection between them that would support the claim that Fenbendazole causes helminthiasis."

         The statement discusses the effects of atrial-selective/predominant sodium channel blockers, such as ranolazine, on atrial fibrillation (AF) in canine models. It does not mention or imply any connection to Fenbendazole or helminthiasis. 

         Helminthiasis is a condition caused by parasitic worms, which Fenbendazole is known to treat in veterinary medicine. The mechanism of action for Fenbendazole is through binding to tubulin, inhibiting its polymerization, which leads to the death of the parasitic worms. This mechanism is unrelated to the electrophysiologic effects of ranolazine discussed in the statement.

        The two statements discuss different drugs (Albendazole and Ranolazine) and their respective effects (causing helminthiasis and decreasing angina pectoris frequency/nitroglycerin consumption). There is no connection between these two drugs or their effects that would allow for indirect support from one statement to the other. 

        Helminthiasis is a condition caused by parasitic worms (helminths) in the body, while ranolazine is used for treating chronic angina (chest pain). Albendazole is an antihelmintic drug used for treating various parasitic worm infestations (helminthiasis).

The background statement refers specifically to Ranolazine, its effects on myocardial ischemia, and its impact on symptom severity in certain patients with chronic angina. It does not mention Albendazole or trichuriasis at all. Therefore, there is no connection or supporting evidence that can be inferred from this statement.

        Trichuriasis is an infection caused by the parasitic worm Trichuris trichiura, also known as whipworm. Albendazole is an anthelmintic medication used to treat various parasitic worm infestations, including trichuriasis. Ranolazine, on the other hand, is a medication used primarily for treating chronic angina.

        In order for there to be indirect support for the claim about Albendazole affecting trichuriasis, there would need to be some connection made between Albendazole, trichuriasis, or related concepts in the statement.

The two statements discuss different drugs and their effects on different conditions; therefore, they are not related.

        To provide indirect support for ""Albendazole affects filarial elephantiasis,"" one would need evidence showing that albendazole has an impact on filarial elephantiasis in humans or animal models. This could include studies demonstrating reduced parasite burden, improved symptoms, or other relevant measures of disease progression after albendazole treatment.

        The conclusion that VAP (presumably referring to a specific treatment regimen) is effective therapy in AIL (Adult Intestinal Lymphangiectasia) does not inherently imply any effect on filariasis, which is a parasitic disease caused by nematode worms of the Filarioidea superfamily. 

        Albendazole is an anthelmintic drug often used in the treatment of filariasis, but its effectiveness is not mentioned or implied in the given statement. Therefore, without additional context linking VAP therapy in AIL to filariasis or Albendazole use, there is no indirect support for the phrase ""Albendazole affects filariasis."""

Ibuprofen is not mentioned in the statement, nor is there any reference made to patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), which is a congenital heart defect unrelated to giant cell arteritis or treatments for it.

        Patent ductus arteriosus is caused by incomplete closure of the ductus arteriosus after birth, which is influenced by various genetic and environmental factors. Ibuprofen is sometimes used as an off-label treatment for PDA in premature infants; however, its effectiveness is still debated in the medical community.

         The conclusion provided is about a treatment regimen called GVP (probably an acronym for some specific medical treatment) in patients with late relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL). It does not mention Ibuprofen at all, nor does it discuss Alzheimer disease.

         Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and bringing down fever. Alzheimer disease is a progressive disorder that causes brain cells to waste away (degenerate) and die. While some studies suggest that NSAIDs like ibuprofen might help prevent Alzheimer disease, there is no definitive evidence supporting this claim yet.

        The two statements discuss different subjects and do not share any logical connection that would allow for one statement to indirectly support the other. The first statement refers to treatment strategies for severe psoriatic arthritis using methotrexate and prednisolone, while the second statement makes an unqualified claim about ibuprofen causing peptic ulcer disease without specifying any causal relationship between these two factors.

        It is important to note that while ibuprofen is known as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can increase the risk of developing peptic ulcers in some individuals when used over an extended period of time, it does not automatically cause peptic ulcer disease in all cases. The development of peptic ulcers is influenced by various factors such as age, genetics, lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption"

The conclusion mentions various factors associated with better survival in AML patients who have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), but it does not mention ibuprofen or fever at all.

         Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and bringing down fevers. Fever is not caused by ibuprofen but rather is one of its potential side effects in rare cases. The conclusion in the study does not provide any evidence or reasoning that would link ibuprofen use to fever occurrence.

        The statement in question is related to a study involving four drugs used in treating refractory multiple myeloma, a type of cancer. Ibuprofen is not mentioned in this statement, nor is there any implicit connection that could be drawn between ibuprofen and pain in this context. Therefore, it does not offer any support for the claim that ibuprofen causes pain. 

        However, it is important to note that ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) often used for pain relief. Misuse or overuse of ibuprofen can lead to side effects such as stomach ulcers or kidney problems, but it does not inherently ""cause pain"". Any association between ibuprofen use and pain would depend on factors such as incorrect dosage, pre-existing conditions, or drug interactions, which are not suggested by the provided statement."

The two statements discuss different concepts that do not have any logical connection between them.

        The first statement refers to pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), an isoform of pyruvate kinase that plays a crucial role in glycolysis; prednisolone resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is a type of cancer affecting white blood cells; and their possible interaction in disease progression or treatment response.

        The second statement is about Ibuprofen, which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and its potential side effect of causing hemorrhage (bleeding).

        The lack of any shared concepts between these two statements makes it impossible for one statement to indirectly support the other."

The statement discusses the effects of various substances (prednisolone, TNFalpha, MTX, IL-1beta) on GDF-5 expression in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibroblasts. Ibuprofen is not mentioned in the statement, so there is no connection to be made between the two phrases. Furthermore, even if ibuprofen were mentioned, a single statement about its effect on GDF-5 expression would not be sufficient evidence to claim it causes arthritic joint disease. A direct causal link would need to be established through rigorous scientific investigation."

The study focuses on the long-term effects of prednisolone and azathioprine in treating membranous nephropathy, which is a kidney disorder. Ibuprofen is an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug that belongs to a different class than prednisolone (a corticosteroid) and azathioprine (an immunosuppressant). The study does not mention ibuprofen nor acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), making it irrelevant in providing support for the claim about ibuprofen's effect on ARDS in adults.

        To further elaborate on why there is no indirect support for the claim about ibuprofen affecting ARDS in adults based on the provided statement, let us consider some aspects of ARDS pathophysiology and ibuprofen pharmacology. ARDS is characterized by inflamm"

The statement discusses the initial dose of prednisolone given to patients with polymyalgia rheumatica, but it does not mention ibuprofen or myalgia at all. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief, while myalgia refers to muscle pain or inflammation. The connection between these terms and the information provided in the statement is tenuous at best. Therefore, it is not reasonable to infer that the statement supports the claim about ibuprofen's effect on myalgia."

The statement discusses the effects of three different glucocorticoids (budesonide, prednisolone, and triamcinolone acetonide) on male rats over an extended period (up to 104 weeks). These glucocorticoids have anti-inflammatory properties similar to ibuprofen; however, they belong to a different class of drugs (corticosteroids). The statement does not mention ibuprofen, fever disruption, or any fever-related outcomes in rats or humans; therefore, it does not provide any support for the claim that ibuprofen disrupts fever."

        The reason is that while both statements involve medications (ibuprofen and prednisone/prednisolone) and diseases (Alzheimer disease and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), they do not share a common link that would allow for indirect support. Prednisone and prednisolone are corticosteroids, while ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). They have different mechanisms of action and are used for different therapeutic purposes. Furthermore, the statement about prednisone and prednisolone discusses their long-term use in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, not Alzheimer disease. Therefore, there is no implicit or explicit connection that would allow for indirect support of the claim about ibuprofen and Alzheimer disease."

        The reason for this is that there is no mention of ibuprofen in the provided statement. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for its analgesic, antipyretic, and anti-inflammatory effects while metacortandralone and prednisolone are corticosteroids used primarily for their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects. 

        The two statements discuss different drugs used for different therapeutic purposes. Therefore, any conclusions drawn about ibuprofen preventing hemorrhage cannot be inferred from the statement about metacortandralone or prednisolone in allergy treatment."

The statement discusses plasma prednisolone levels after administration of prednisolone-21-phosphate as a retention enema in colitis. This has no direct or indirect relation to ibuprofen or canker sores. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief, while canker sores are small, shallow lesions that develop on the soft tissues in your mouth or at the base of your gums. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid medication used for suppressing the immune system and reducing inflammation. Therefore, there is no connection between these two statements."

The two statements discuss different subjects - one is about ibuprofen potentially alleviating symptoms of dysmenorrhea (a specific type of menstrual pain) while the other is about mizoribine as an effective combined maintenance therapy for child-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (a chronic autoimmune disease).

        The connection between these two statements is tenuous at best since they cover separate medical issues and treatments. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for pain relief including dysmenorrhea, whereas mizoribine is an immunosuppressive medication used in treating autoimmune diseases like lupus.

        Therefore, without further context linking these two statements together, it is inappropriate to infer that there is any indirect support for ibuprofen preventing dysmenorrhea from the given statement about mizoribine in lupus treatment."

        The statement refers to a clinical trial involving prednisolone and cytotoxics for treating progressive IgA nephropathy, which is a kidney disease. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used primarily for relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and bringing down fever. 

        Although Ibuprofen can help manage chronic pain by reducing inflammation, it is not mentioned nor implied in the provided statement about IgA nephropathy treatment. The two subjects—IgA nephropathy treatment and chronic pain management—are unrelated in this context. Therefore, no indirect support can be inferred from one statement to another based on their respective contents."

        The statement refers to a study involving the use of prednisolone, a corticosteroid, in treating Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. This study investigates the potential benefits of prednisolone in managing DMD symptoms, which is unrelated to ibuprofen's potential effects on injury prevention.

        Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for pain relief, fever reduction, and inflammation control. While both ibuprofen and prednisolone have anti-inflammatory properties, they have different mechanisms of action and therapeutic applications.

        Therefore, any evidence supporting prednisolone's use in DMD would not necessarily imply that ibuprofen prevents injury. To establish such indirect support, there would need to be a clear connection between the two subjects in question, which is absent"

        The two statements are unrelated as they discuss different subjects - one is about Ibuprofen preventing patent ductus arteriosus (a congenital heart defect) while the other is about prednisolone reversibility in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). 

        Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a congenital heart defect where a blood vessel in an infant's heart does not close properly after birth. Ibuprofen is sometimes used as an medication to help close PDA in preterm infants. 

        Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid medication used for its anti-inflammatory effects in COPD treatment.

The provided statement discusses prednisolone-based treatment for pemphigus patients and explores alternative therapeutic approaches due to undesirable effects associated with prednisolone treatment. Ibuprofen is not mentioned in the statement, nor is there any connection made between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and Alzheimer disease prevention.

         While some studies suggest that NSAIDs might have potential benefits in reducing Alzheimer disease risk or slowing its progression, these findings do not support the claim that ibuprofen prevents Alzheimer disease specifically. Moreover, recent meta-analyses have questioned the robustness of these associations between NSAIDs and Alzheimer disease risk reduction. Therefore, it is crucial to approach such claims cautiously and consider them in light of current scientific understanding and rigorous evaluation of available evidence."

        The statement is about prednisolone, a corticosteroid drug, and its potential mechanism of action in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It suggests that prednisolone may have beneficial effects by down-regulating adhesion and phagocytosis receptors on monocytes, which are types of white blood cells involved in inflammation.

        Ibuprofen, on the other hand, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used for pain relief and inflammation reduction. The statement does not mention ibuprofen or provide any information about its effects on injury or inflammation. Therefore, it does not indirectly support the idea that ibuprofen exacerbates injury.

The objective of the study is to evaluate the adjunctive role of prednisolone in pulmonary tuberculosis and its toxic reactions. This study has no direct or indirect relation to ibuprofen or cerebral palsy. Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) while prednisolone is a corticosteroid, they have different mechanisms of action and uses in treatment. Cerebral palsy is a group of neurological disorders that affect movement and coordination while pulmonary tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that primarily affects the lungs. Therefore, there is no connection between ibuprofen, cerebral palsy and this study objective."

The statement refers to prednisolone being converted to prednisone in rabbits, which has no direct relevance or implied connection to Ivabradine or atrial fibrillation. Ivabradine is a medication used primarily for heart failure and angina pectoris treatment, while prednisolone is a corticosteroid used for its anti-inflammatory effects in various conditions.

        To establish indirect support for Ivabradine causing atrial fibrillation from such a statement, there would need to be some shared context or underlying mechanism between prednisolone conversion in rabbits and Ivabradine-induced atrial fibrillation in humans. Since no such connection exists in the provided statement, it cannot be used as indirect evidence supporting the claim that Ivabradine causes atrial fibrillation.

        The connection between these two pieces of information is tenuous at best because they discuss different medical issues - one being an adverse reaction to topical steroids and the other being prevention of otitis media (middle ear infection) through antibiics. Therefore, it does not contribute meaningful evidence towards supporting or refuting the claim about Cefixime preventing otitis media."
17748395,Trimetazidine related to diabetic kidney disease,191,[Pulmonary tuberculosis due to prednisolone].,False,"'Does the phrase ""Trimetazidine related to diabetic kidney disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""[Pulmonary tuberculosis due to prednisolone].""?","No, the statement ""Pulmonary tuberculosis due to prednisolone"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Trimetazidine related to diabetic kidney disease."" 

        The two statements discuss different medical conditions and drugs. The first statement refers to pulmonary tuberculosis caused by prednisolone, which is a corticosteroid often used in treating inflammatory diseases. In contrast, the second phrase relates to Trimetazidine, a medication used primarily in treating angina (chest pain) by improving blood flow in the heart muscle, and its potential relationship with diabetic kidney disease.

        The connection between pulmonary tuberculosis due to prednisolone and Trimetazidine related to diabetic kidney disease is tenuous at best since they involve different organ systems (respiratory vs cardiovascular/renal) and distinct disease processes (infection vs metabolic dysfunction). Therefore, it is unlikely that one statement provides indirect support for the other in terms of their respective biological plausibility or clinical relevance."

The statement indicates that prednisolone treatment has similar effects on heaves score, blood gases, and endoscopic scores when compared to dexamethasone treatment in horses suffering from heaves (a chronic inflammatory airway disease). Synovitis is an inflammation of synovial membranes lining joints which can be caused by various factors including inflammatory conditions like heaves. Prednisolone is known for its anti-inflammatory properties which could help manage synovitis symptoms by reducing inflammation in affected joints. However, it is important to note that while prednisolone may have beneficial effects on synovitis as an indirect consequence of its anti-inflammatory action in treating heaves, there is no explicit mention of synovitis in the provided statement."

The statement discusses the effects of prednisolone treatment on eosinophilia in 20 patients, two of whom had splenomegaly and poor response to corticosteroids (which include prednisolone). Sarcoma is not mentioned in the statement at all, so there is no connection that can be inferred between prednisolone and sarcoma based on this information alone."

        The statement suggests that prednisolone is being used in the treatment of exacerbations in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, two conditions that can be associated with uveitis. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye between the retina and the white of the eye (sclera). It can cause symptoms such as eye pain and redness, blurred vision, floaters, and sensitivity to light.

        
        While the statement does not explicitly mention uveitis, it does imply that prednisolone is being used in a context where inflammatory eye conditions like uveitis might occur. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid often used to reduce inflammation, which is a common factor in many diseases, including uveitis. Therefore, while not direct evidence, the statement does provide some level of indirect support for the connection between"

        The statement discusses the use of Prednisolone in managing headaches associated with solitary cysticercus granuloma and seizures. Glomerulonephritis is a kidney disease that involves inflammation of the glomeruli, which is not mentioned or implied in the statement. Therefore, there is no connection established between Prednisolone and glomerulonephritis in this context. 

        However, it is important to note that Prednisolone is a corticosteroid often used in treating various conditions due to its anti-inflammatory properties. In some cases, corticosteroids like Prednisolone have been used in treating glomerulonephritis, but this is not suggested by the provided statement. Any connection between Prednisolone and glomerulonephritis would need separate evidence and justification."

        The statement indicates that a patient was treated with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydoxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone) for lymphoma. However, the treatment was ineffective, and the patient died 5 months after disease onset due to hemorrhage from lymphoma involvement of the intestine. 

        Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid often used in treating subacute thyroiditis due to its potent anti-inflammatory effects that can help manage symptoms such as pain and swelling (1). Although prednisolone was used in combination therapy for lymphoma in this case, it does not negate its potential effect on subacute thyroiditis if present in the patient. 

        However, it is important to note that no direct causality is established between prednisolone use and subacute thyroiditis in this statement. The ineffectiveness of CHOP therapy in controlling lymphoma"

        The reason is that the statement pertains specifically to nephropathy (kidney disease) in rats, not pulmonary eosinophilia (a condition characterized by an increased number of eosinophils in the lungs). Therefore, while prednisolone may have an effect on certain conditions, it does not necessarily imply that it is related to pulmonary eosinophilia. 

        However, it is important to note that this does not rule out the possibility that prednisolone could be related to pulmonary eosinophilia in other contexts or experiments. It simply means that the provided statement does not offer support for that specific claim."

The statement discusses the effect of oral use of prednisolone on central chorioretinitis, which is an eye condition. It does not mention or imply anything about prednisolone's potential relationship with habitual spontaneous abortion. Therefore, it does not contribute any relevant information to the consideration of that phrase."
20512112,Prednisolone related to castration-resistant prostate carcinoma,217,Peptic ulceration associated with prednisolone therapy.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to castration-resistant prostate carcinoma"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Peptic ulceration associated with prednisolone therapy.""?","No, the statement ""Peptic ulceration associated with prednisolone therapy"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to castration-resistant prostate carcinoma."" 

        The association between prednisolone therapy and peptic ulceration is related to side effects of prednisolone use, not its therapeutic effect on castration-resistant prostate carcinoma. Prednisolone is a glucocorticoid that has been used in treating prostate cancer due to its anti-inflammatory properties and potential immune system modulation. However, there is no direct link between prednisolone use and castration-resistant prostate carcinoma based on this information alone.

        It is essential to consider that correlation does not imply causation; therefore, any association between prednisolone therapy and peptic ulceration does not necessarily translate into an association between prednisolone use and castration-resistant prostate carcinoma. To establish such a link, further evidence from well-designed studies specifically investigating prednisolone's effects on castration-resistant prostate"

The statement indicates that glucocorticoids like prednisolone are used in treating acute exacerbations of ulcerative colitis (UC). This implies that prednisolone has some effect on the body's immune response, given that UC is an autoimmune condition. Chronic primary adrenal insufficiency is also related to issues with the body's immune system and its regulation of cortisol levels. Therefore, there is an indirect link between prednisolone and chronic primary adrenal insufficiency through their common involvement in immune response regulation. However, it is important to note that this does not imply causation, but rather an association based on their shared physiological roles."

         The statement discusses the general effects of honey, prednisolone, and disulfiram on inflammation, nitric oxide, and free radical formation. While prednisolone is mentioned, there is no context linking it specifically to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Therefore, without additional information specifically tying prednisolone to allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, one cannot infer a relationship between the two based on this statement alone."

        The statement in question pertains to an ETO (etoposide) and PSL (prednisolone) combination treatment's effect on anti-tumor activity. The failure of this combination treatment to enhance anti-tumor effects does not inherently imply any connection to temporal arteritis, which is an inflammatory disease affecting large and medium-sized arteries, commonly the temporal arteries. Prednisolone is indeed used in treating temporal arteritis due to its anti-inflammatory properties; however, its failure in enhancing anti-tumor effects in this specific context does not provide any evidence supporting its relation to temporal arteritis."

The statement discusses the sensitivity of My- and My+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) to various drugs including prednisolone, but it does not mention or imply any connection between prednisolone and Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma is a distinct type of cancer from acute lymphoblastic leukemia, so results from studies on one cannot be directly applied to the other without additional evidence. Therefore, without further information linking prednisolone to Hodgkin lymphoma, the statement does not offer any support for that claim."
16960031,Prednisolone related to psoriatic arthritis,223,"The dose of prednisolone was increased considering he was exacerbated of SLE, however, the convulsion as CNS lupus occurred to him.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to psoriatic arthritis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The dose of prednisolone was increased considering he was exacerbated of SLE, however, the convulsion as CNS lupus occurred to him.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to psoriatic arthritis"". 

         The statement discusses a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who experienced an increase in their prednisolone dose due to an exacerbation of their SLE condition. Additionally, it mentions that the patient had a convulsion due to central nervous system (CNS) lupus. There is no mention of psoriatic arthritis in the statement. 

         Prednisolone is a corticosteroid often used in treating various conditions such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune disorders due to its potent anti-inflammatory effects. However, there is no direct or indirect connection established between prednisolone use and psoriatic arthritis in this statement.

         Psoriatic arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects some individuals with psoriasis, but it is not typically treated with prednisolone due to potential side effects such as increased risk"

The pilot study mentioned in the statement investigates the clearance values of prednisone and prednisolone in rabbits based on varying infusion rates of these drugs. Although it demonstrates how altering infusion rates affects drug clearance, it does not provide any information about prednisolone causing aplastic anemia in any organism, including humans. Aplastic anemia is an immune-mediated disease that could have multiple factors contributing to its development; therefore, further investigation is required before making any connection between prednisolone use and aplastic anemia risk."
16371065,Prednisolone related to celiac disease,225,"Budesonide is equal to less effective than prednisolone or prednisone therapy in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, but is associated with fewer glucocorticoids adverse reactions.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to celiac disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Budesonide is equal to less effective than prednisolone or prednisone therapy in the treatment of active Crohn's disease, but is associated with fewer glucocorticoids adverse reactions.""?","No, the statement does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to celiac disease."" The statement discusses the efficacy of Budesonide versus Prednisolone/Prednisone in treating Crohn's disease and their associated adverse reactions. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder distinct from Crohn's disease, so no connection can be inferred between Prednisolone and celiac disease from this statement alone."

        The statement in question is an experimental result demonstrating that both diclofenac and prednisolone can inhibit endotoxin-induced uveitis in rabbits. While it does indicate that prednisolone has immunosuppressive properties in certain contexts, it does not establish any connection between prednisolone and dermatomyositis.

        Dermatomyositis is an idiopathic inflammatory myopathy characterized by muscle weakness, skin rash, and elevated muscle enzymes in serum. Prednisolone is indeed used as an off-label treatment for dermatomyositis due to its immunosuppressive properties; however, its efficacy is still under investigation in clinical trials.

        Therefore, although prednisolone may be related to dermatomyositis as a treatment option, the statement provided does not offer"

        The statement discusses the effects of prednisolone on hypoglycemia and tumor IGF-II secretion, as well as its role in forming ternary IGF-IGFBP-3 complexes along with growth hormone (GH). However, it does not mention or imply any connection between prednisolone and mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. 

        Mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, also known as Kawasaki disease, is an illness characterized by inflammation of blood vessels throughout the body. It is typically associated with fever, rash, swelling of lymph nodes, and inflammation of mucous membranes in the mouth, nose, and throat. While corticosteroids like prednisolone have been used in its treatment, there is no direct link established in the statement between prednisolone and the syndrome itself. 

        Therefore, based on the provided statement, there is no reason to infer a relationship between prednisol"

The statement discusses an experiment where an aqueous extract of Saiboku-to inhibited contact dermatitis and enhanced prednisolone's inhibition of contact dermatitis. While prednisolone is a glucocorticoid often used in treating plasma cell myeloma, there is no mention of myeloma in the statement; thus, it does not support any relationship between prednisolone and plasma cell myeloma."
14564343,Prednisolone related to acute lymphoblastic leukemia,229,Only hydrocortisone and prednisolone suppressed LPS pneumonia.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to acute lymphoblastic leukemia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Only hydrocortisone and prednisolone suppressed LPS pneumonia.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to acute lymphoblastic leukemia."" 

        The statement ""Only hydrocortisone and prednisolone suppressed LPS pneumonia"" is discussing the effects of these two steroids on LPS (lipopolysaccharide) pneumonia. It does not provide any information about acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which is a type of cancer where the bone marrow makes too many immature white blood cells. 

        Prednisolone is indeed a type of steroid often used in cancer treatments due to its anti-inflammatory properties, but its use in ALL is not necessarily related to its ability to suppress LPS pneumonia. Therefore, without further evidence linking prednisolone use to ALL, we cannot infer any relationship between these two entities based on the given statement."

The statement ""Prednisolone significantly inhibited the measurable sensitivity of IDT, while oclacitinib did not"" is about Prednisolone's effect on IDT sensitivity, not its relationship to osteoarthritis. IDT likely refers to an Immunodetection Test, but there is no direct or indirect connection made between Prednisolone, IDT sensitivity, and osteoarthritis in this statement."
13151963,Prednisolone related to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma,231,"A comparison with the bronchodilator potency of the above drugs indicated that in guinea pigs salbutamol appears relatively selective as a bronchodilator, prednisolone is selective as an inhibitor of eosinophilia whilst theophylline displays a balance of both activities.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""A comparison with the bronchodilator potency of the above drugs indicated that in guinea pigs salbutamol appears relatively selective as a bronchodilator, prednisolone is selective as an inhibitor of eosinophilia whilst theophylline displays a balance of both activities.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma."" The statement discusses the pharmacological effects of prednisolone in guinea pigs, specifically its ability to inhibit eosinophilia (a condition characterized by an increased number of eosinophils in the blood), not its relationship with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

        Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects B-cells (a type of white blood cell). While prednisolone is a corticosteroid that can suppress immune system activity (which could potentially impact cancer growth), there is no mention of such an association in the provided statement. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to infer any connection between prednisolone and DLBCL based on this information alone.

        To establish whether there is any relationship between prednisolone and DLBCL, one would need to review studies specifically designed to investigate that potential link. This might include clinical trials, epidemiological studies, or laboratory experiments designed to assess how prednisolone affects DLBCL cells"

         The statement discusses the reduction of prednisolone doses in bronchial asthma through the concurrent use of hydroxyzine. It does not mention or imply any connection between prednisolone and follicular lymphoma. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid often used in treating various conditions such as asthma, allergies, and autoimmune disorders due to its anti-inflammatory properties. Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and its development is associated with genetic factors and immune system dysfunction; however, there is no direct link established between prednisolone use and follicular lymphoma in this statement."

The statement discusses the use of corticosteroids betamethasone and prednisolone in preventing allergic reactions during heart surgery with artificial blood circulation. There is no mention of membranous glomerulonephritis in this context. Membranous glomerulonephritis is a specific kidney disease involving inflammation of the glomeruli, which may be associated with various causes including autoimmune diseases, infections, medications, and cancer but not explicitly linked to prednisolone in this statement."
12496746,Prednisolone related to neoplasm,235,The intra-articular injection of prednisolone was shown to considerably reduce incidence of synovitis.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to neoplasm"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The intra-articular injection of prednisolone was shown to considerably reduce incidence of synovitis.""?","No, the statement ""The intra-articular injection of prednisolone was shown to considerably reduce incidence of synovitis"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to neoplasm"". 

        The reason is that these two statements discuss different medical conditions. Synovitis is an inflammation of the synovial membrane, which lines joints, while neoplasm refers to an abnormal growth of cells, which can be benign or malignant (cancerous). 

        Although prednisolone is a corticosteroid often used to reduce inflammation in various conditions including synovitis, there is no direct or indirect link established in these statements between prednisolone use and neoplasm. 

        It is important to note that while some medications can have side effects that increase the risk of certain conditions (like some chemotherapy drugs increasing the risk of secondary cancers), this specific statement does not provide evidence for such a link between prednisolone and neoplasm."
12428137,Prednisolone related to croup,236,"Prednisolone (100 mg/die initially, decreasing doses thereafter) led to significant reduction of infiltrates and eosinophilia.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to croup"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Prednisolone (100 mg/die initially, decreasing doses thereafter) led to significant reduction of infiltrates and eosinophilia.""?","Yes, there is indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to croup"" from the statement provided. 

         The statement suggests that Prednisolone (a type of corticosteroid) led to a significant reduction in infiltrates and eosinophilia when administered at 100 mg/die initially, decreasing doses thereafter. This finding implies that Prednisolone has an impact on inflammation and immune response, as infiltrates and eosinophilia are both indicators of inflammation in the body.

         Croup is an inflammatory disease of the upper airway that typically affects young children. It is characterized by symptoms such as barking cough, stridor (noisy breathing), and hoarseness. Given that Prednisolone has been shown to reduce inflammation in other contexts (as suggested by the statement), it is reasonable to infer that Prednisolone may also be effective in treating croup by reducing inflammation in the upper airway.

         However, it is important to note that while there is indirect support for this claim based on the provided statement, direct evidence specifically linking Prednis"

The statement ""The tumour was significantly reduced by prednisolone"" suggests that prednisolone has an effect on reducing tumours. West syndrome is a severe epileptic encephalopathy in infants and children, often associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is characterized by the development of benign tumours in various organs including the brain. If prednisolone is effective in reducing these tumours, it could potentially have an impact on the severity of West syndrome symptoms. However, this is a very indirect link and more specific evidence would be needed to directly connect prednisolone to West syndrome."

The statement suggests that Prednisolone has an impact on colitis prevention or progression. In Crohn disease, colitis is one of its manifestations. Therefore, if Prednisolone can prevent colitis development as stated, it implies that Prednisolone may have a protective effect against Crohn disease progression, at least in terms of colitis development. However, more direct evidence would be needed to definitively say that Prednisolone is related to Crohn disease prevention or treatment."
11638013,Prednisolone related to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis,239,Alveolar NO concentration was increased in patients with refractory asthma (7.1 ppb) compared with mild-to-moderate asthma (3.4 ppb) and normal controls (3.4 ppb) and reduced by treatment with prednisolone.,True,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Alveolar NO concentration was increased in patients with refractory asthma (7.1 ppb) compared with mild-to-moderate asthma (3.4 ppb) and normal controls (3.4 ppb) and reduced by treatment with prednisolone.""?","Yes, indirect support can be inferred from the statement provided for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis"" (EGPA). The statement indicates that prednisolone reduces alveolar nitric oxide (NO) concentration in patients with refractory asthma compared to those with mild-to-moderate asthma and normal controls. This suggests that prednisolone has an impact on airway inflammation since increased alveolar NO concentration is associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma patients (1).

         EGPA is characterized by necrotizing vasculitis affecting small-to-medium-sized vessels and extravascular granulomas rich in eosinophils (2). Although prednisolone is not specifically related to EGPA in the statement, its effect on reducing alveolar NO concentration implies that it may help control eosinophilic inflammation in general. This is relevant because eosinophilic inflammation is also implicated in EGPA pathogenesis (3). Therefore, prednisolone might"

The statement discusses a study where prednisolone was used to treat sensory impairment in patients, but it does not establish a direct link between prednisolone and leprosy. The study only mentions leprosy in relation to potential nerve function impairment as a secondary effect of the disease itself, not as an outcome of prednisolone treatment. Therefore, there is no evidence in this statement that prednisolone has any effect on leprosy or its reactions."

Prednisolone is an immunosuppressive medication often used in treating various conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and lupus nephritis (LN). The statement indicates that prednisolone was initiated six weeks prior to symptom onset in relation to UC aggravation.

         However, it is essential to acknowledge that correlation does not imply causation. The statement does not explicitly connect prednisolone use to lupus nephritis symptoms in this case. To establish a direct relationship between prednisolone use and lupus nephritis symptoms, further evidence would be required, such as documentation of worsening LN symptoms following prednisolone initiation, laboratory results indicating increased disease activity, or other clinical manifestations consistent with LN flares during treatment.

         It is also important to consider that prednisolone is frequently used as part of standard therapy for both UC and LN; therefore, its use alone does not necessarily indicate causation for LN symptoms. Nonetheless, based on"

The statement does not explicitly link prednisolone to leukemia but it does suggest that prednisolone is part of a chemotherapy regimen (R-CHOP) used for treating non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This implies that prednisolone is used in cancer treatment, which could potentially include leukemia since it is also a type of cancer. Furthermore, chemotherapy is known to increase the risk of secondary cancers, including leukemia, due to its DNA-damaging effects. However, it is important to note that this is an indirect association and does not establish a direct causal link between prednisolone and leukemia."

        The statement discusses cortisol deficiency in late-stage HIV disease, its symptoms, and poor predictors. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in treating various conditions, including polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). However, there is no direct or indirect connection established between cortisol deficiency in HIV disease and prednisolone use in PMR in the provided statement.

        Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory condition characterized by muscle pain and stiffness in the shoulders and hips. Although it has been associated with low cortisol levels in some cases, it is not exclusively tied to cortisol deficiency as seen in HIV patients. Prednisolone is used in PMR treatment due to its anti-inflammatory properties rather than its potential impact on cortisol levels in HIV patients.

        Therefore, without further information linking cortisol deficiency in HIV disease to prednisolone use in PMR treatment,"

        The statement ""Plasma cortisol and 17-ketosteroids in urine in relation to cardiac arrest"" is discussing two hormones, cortisol (a glucocorticoid) and 17-ketosteroids (a group of metabolites that include testosterone), in relation to cardiac arrest. 

        Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone often used in medical treatments for its anti-inflammatory effects. While it is true that glucocorticoids like prednisolone can impact fertility by suppressing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and gonadal function, the statement provided does not mention prednisolone or infertility. 

        Therefore, without explicit mention of prednisolone or infertility in the statement, it does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to infertility disorder."""

        The statement discusses the independence of certain surface antigens in murine lymphoma cells and their response to various substances including cortisol, but it does not mention prednisolone nor does it provide any context that would suggest a link between prednisolone and atopic dermatitis. 

        Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in treating various inflammatory diseases due to its anti-inflammatory effects. Atopic dermatitis is one such condition where prednisolone might be used. However, this statement does not provide any evidence or implications about such usage or relationship. 

        Therefore, without further information connecting prednisolone and atopic dermatitis, one cannot infer support for the given phrase from the provided statement."

The statement mentions that prednisolone has a superior anti-inflammatory effect compared to hydrocortisone and supports the assumption of inflammation related to CD (presumably an abbreviation for a condition). Graves disease is indeed associated with inflammation, particularly in its early stages. Therefore, if prednisolone is effective at reducing inflammation, it could potentially be beneficial in managing symptoms of Graves disease. However, this is an indirect inference and does not explicitly state that prednisolone is related to Graves disease. It would require further direct evidence to confirm such a relationship."

Therefore, there is no connection between prednisolone and keratitis in this context."
10703266,Prednisolone related to ulcerative colitis,251,"The incidence of psychological symptoms as somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, anxiety, phobia, and nonspecific symptoms is statistically increased in pregnant women with elevated morning cortisol, but in women with elevated afternoon cortisol also occurring aggressiveness and paranoia.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to ulcerative colitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The incidence of psychological symptoms as somatization, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, depression, anxiety, phobia, and nonspecific symptoms is statistically increased in pregnant women with elevated morning cortisol, but in women with elevated afternoon cortisol also occurring aggressiveness and paranoia.""?","No, the statement does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to ulcerative colitis."" The statement discusses the psychological symptoms associated with elevated cortisol levels in pregnant women, but it does not mention Prednisolone or ulcerative colitis. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used in various conditions for its anti-inflammatory effects, including ulcerative colitis management. However, the statement does not establish any connection between Prednisolone and ulcerative colitis. Therefore, it does not support the phrase in question."
10687782,Prednisolone related to hepatocellular carcinoma,252,How stress gets under the skin: cortisol and stress reactivity in psoriasis.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to hepatocellular carcinoma"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""How stress gets under the skin: cortisol and stress reactivity in psoriasis.""?","No, the statement ""How stress gets under the skin: cortisol and stress reactivity in psoriasis"" does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to hepatocellular carcinoma."" 

        Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone used primarily for its anti-inflammatory effects. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a type of liver cancer. While both prednisolone and stress (which can increase cortisol levels) can have effects on the liver, there is no inherent connection between prednisolone use and hepatocellular carcinoma suggested in the provided statement. 

        The statement discusses cortisol, a stress hormone, and its relationship to psoriasis, an inflammatory skin condition. It does not mention prednisolone or liver cancer. Therefore, it does not provide any support for the proposed connection between prednisolone and hepatocellular carcinoma. 

        However, it is important to note that long-term use of high-dose corticosteroids like prednis"
10623724,Prednisolone related to hemolytic anemia,253,Absorption of hydrocortisone from the skin reservoir in atopic dermatitis.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to hemolytic anemia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Absorption of hydrocortisone from the skin reservoir in atopic dermatitis.""?","No, the statement ""Absorption of hydrocortisone from the skin reservoir in atopic dermatitis"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to hemolytic anemia."" 

        The two statements discuss different corticosteroids (hydrocortisone vs prednisolone) and their distinct effects on the body (skin absorption vs potential hemolytic anemia). Hemolytic anemia is an adverse effect that has been associated mainly with certain corticosteroids like prednisone and prednisolone but not hydrocortisone.

        Therefore, since there is no direct nor indirect connection between these two statements in terms of their respective corticosteroids or associated adverse effects, one cannot infer that prednisolone is related to hemolytic anemia based on hydrocortisone absorption in atopic dermatitis alone.

        However, it is essential to note that both hydrocortisone and prednisolone belong to the same class of medications (glucocorticoids), which can potentially cause various adverse effects depending on individual patient factors,"
10576837,Prednisolone related to juvenile idiopathic arthritis,254,OBJECTIVE: To assess dexamethasone (DEX) and hydrocortisone (HC) use in premature infants over time and the association of steroid use with the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to juvenile idiopathic arthritis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""OBJECTIVE: To assess dexamethasone (DEX) and hydrocortisone (HC) use in premature infants over time and the association of steroid use with the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to juvenile idiopathic arthritis"". The objective of the study mentioned is to assess dexamethasone (DEX) and hydrocortisone (HC) use in premature infants over time and their association with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks postmenstrual age. Prednisolone is not mentioned in the objective, nor is juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Therefore, it does not offer any form of support for the given phrase."
10565620,Prednisolone related to nephrotic syndrome,255,Increased ratio of mRNA expression of the genes CYP17 and CYP11B1 indicates autonomous cortisol production in adrenocortical tumors.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to nephrotic syndrome"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Increased ratio of mRNA expression of the genes CYP17 and CYP11B1 indicates autonomous cortisol production in adrenocortical tumors.""?","No, the statement does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to nephrotic syndrome."" 

         Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in treating nephrotic syndrome, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the provided statement about mRNA expression ratios of CYP17 and CYP11B1 in adrenocortical tumors. The statement discusses cortisol production in adrenocortical tumors but does not connect it to Prednisolone usage or nephrotic syndrome occurrence.

         The mRNA expression ratios of CYP17 and CYP11B1 can indicate autonomous cortisol production in adrenocortical tumors; however, autonomous cortisol production is not synonymous with Prednisolone usage in nephrotic syndrome cases. Therefore, while both Prednisolone usage in nephrotic syndrome treatment and mRNA expression ratios of CYP17 and CYP11B1 in adrenocortical tumors may be related to cortisol production, there is no explicit connection between them in the given statement"
10531966,Prednisolone related to allergic disease,256,"It is concluded that bile acids are potent endogenous inhibitors of 11 beta-HSD and, therefore, could participate in abnormalities of cortisol metabolism observed in liver cirrhosis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction and, possibly, after ingestion of bile acids.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to allergic disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""It is concluded that bile acids are potent endogenous inhibitors of 11 beta-HSD and, therefore, could participate in abnormalities of cortisol metabolism observed in liver cirrhosis and extrahepatic biliary obstruction and, possibly, after ingestion of bile acids.""?","No, the statement does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to allergic disease."" The conclusion in the statement is about bile acids being potent endogenous inhibitors of 11 beta-HSD, which could potentially influence cortisol metabolism abnormalities in certain medical conditions. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used primarily for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects and is not directly related to bile acids or allergic disease based on this information alone.

        However, it is important to note that Prednisolone is sometimes used in treating allergic conditions due to its immunosuppressive properties; therefore, further context is required to establish any potential connection between Prednisolone use in allergic disease and bile acids as mentioned in the statement. Nonetheless, based on the provided statement alone, there is no clear relationship established between Prednisolone and allergic disease in relation to bile acids or their effects on cortisol metabolism."
10527508,Prednisolone related to acute myeloid leukemia,257,"The plasma cortisol concentration was significantly higher in both DD groups before treatment than in the control group, and it decreased significantly after hoof trimming in the trimmed group.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to acute myeloid leukemia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The plasma cortisol concentration was significantly higher in both DD groups before treatment than in the control group, and it decreased significantly after hoof trimming in the trimmed group.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to acute myeloid leukemia."" 

         The statement discusses the plasma cortisol concentration in different groups before and after treatment, specifically in relation to hoof trimming. Cortisol is a steroid hormone that the body produces in response to stress; it is not Prednisolone, which is a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone used in medical treatments for various conditions such as allergies, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and even some types of cancer (including acute myeloid leukemia).

         While both cortisol and Prednisolone have similar effects in the body due to their glucocorticoid activity (e.g., suppressing inflammation), they are not the same substance. Therefore, any changes in cortisol levels before and after treatment do not necessarily imply any relationship between Prednisolone and acute myeloid leukemia.

         To establish such a relationship, direct evidence would be required, such as epidemiological studies showing an association between Prednisolone use and acute"

        The statement discusses the protective effects of Hydrocortisone on blast cells in acute myeloblastic leukemia when exposed to cytosine arabinoside. This finding is relevant to leukemia treatment and drug interactions but does not relate to Prednisolone or seasonal allergic rhinitis. 

        Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used primarily in treating various inflammatory diseases such as asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is typically managed by avoiding allergens and using medications such as antihistamines, decongestants, or intranasal corticosteroids (e.g., fluticasone). 

        Although Prednisolone has anti-inflammatory properties like Hydrocortisone, their applications differ significantly based on their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles. Therefore, evidence supporting one drug's efficacy"
10496403,Prednisolone related to Inflammation,259,Continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion in Addison's disease.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to Inflammation"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion in Addison's disease.""?","No, the statement ""Continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion in Addison's disease"" does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to Inflammation."" 

        The statement discusses the use of hydrocortisone in Addison's disease, which is a condition characterized by insufficient production of hormones by the adrenal glands. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid that can help replace these missing hormones. 

        Prednisolone, on the other hand, is also a corticosteroid but it is not the same as hydrocortisone. While both hydrocortisone and prednisolone can have anti-inflammatory effects, they are not interchangeable in terms of their clinical use and effects on the body. 

        Therefore, the statement about hydrocortisone infusion in Addison's disease does not provide any relevant information about prednisolone or its relationship to inflammation. 

        It is important to note that while corticosteroids like prednisolone can reduce inflammation,"

The statement discusses cortisol and DHEA assessments in relation to stress regulation in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Prednisolone and Prednisone are both synthetic glucocorticoids used in medical treatments but they are not mentioned nor implied in the provided context. Therefore, it is not appropriate to make such a connection based on this statement alone."

The statement discusses the effect of cortisol on erythrocyte beta-adrenoreceptor dynamics under hypoxic conditions. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in treating inflammatory bowel diseases such as colitis; however, it is not mentioned nor implied in the given statement. Therefore, there is no basis for inferring any relationship between Prednisolone and colitis from this information alone."
9437304,Prednisolone related to systemic lupus erythematosus,262,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to deficiency of 21-hydroxylase is a disorder of the adrenal cortex characterised by cortisol deficiency, with or without aldosterone deficiency, and androgen excess.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to systemic lupus erythematosus"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to deficiency of 21-hydroxylase is a disorder of the adrenal cortex characterised by cortisol deficiency, with or without aldosterone deficiency, and androgen excess.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to systemic lupus erythematosus"". 

        The statement discusses congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which is caused by a deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, leading to cortisol deficiency, possible aldosterone deficiency, and androgen excess. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in treating various conditions such as inflammation, allergies, and autoimmune disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

        While both CAH and SLE involve corticosteroid hormones (cortisol in CAH and both cortisol and other hormones in SLE), there is no direct connection between CAH and SLE mentioned in either statement. Prednisolone is used in treating SLE but is not inherently related to CAH beyond its function as a glucocorticoid hormone.

        Therefore, these statements do not provide indirect support for ""Prednisolone related to systemic lupus ery"
9282196,Prednisolone related to IgA glomerulonephritis,263,"Changes of smoking behavior and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, prolactin, and endogenous opioids levels in nicotine dependence after naltrexone treatment.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to IgA glomerulonephritis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Changes of smoking behavior and serum adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, prolactin, and endogenous opioids levels in nicotine dependence after naltrexone treatment.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to IgA glomerulonephritis."" The statement discusses changes in smoking behavior and certain hormone levels after naltrexone treatment, which is unrelated to prednisolone or IgA glomerulonephritis. IgA glomerulonephritis is an autoimmune kidney disease, while prednisolone is a corticosteroid used in treating various conditions such as inflammation and allergies. The connection between these entities and the information provided in the statement is tenuous at best."

         The statement discusses hydrocortisone infusion in severe community-acquired pneumonia and its potential effects on systemic inflammation, resolution of pneumonia, and reduction of sepsis-related complications. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, similar to prednisolone, but they are not identical. 

         Moreover, hypereosinophilic syndrome is a condition characterized by an elevated eosinophil count in the blood (greater than 1500 eosinophils per microliter), which can lead to tissue damage if left untreated. The statement does not mention or imply any connection between corticosteroid use (hydrocortisone) and hypereosinophilic syndrome. Therefore, it does not offer indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to hypereosinophilic syndrome""."

The prospective study mentioned in the statement investigates the combination of aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide and hydrocortisone in treating androgen-independent prostate cancer. Prednisolone is not mentioned in the study, nor is there any connection made between the drugs being studied (aminoglutethimide and hydrocortisone) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Therefore, it is not possible to infer any relationship between Prednisolone and non-Hodgkin lymphoma based on this statement alone."
9208405,Prednisolone related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy,266,"To investigate the time courses of the effects of the exogenous glucocorticoid agonists dexamethasone (DEX) and hydrocortisone (HYD) and a glucocorticoid antagonist (RU-38486), and to characterize the local and systemic responses in experimental AP.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""To investigate the time courses of the effects of the exogenous glucocorticoid agonists dexamethasone (DEX) and hydrocortisone (HYD) and a glucocorticoid antagonist (RU-38486), and to characterize the local and systemic responses in experimental AP.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to Duchenne muscular dystrophy."" The statement discusses an investigation into the effects of certain glucocorticoid agonists (dexamethasone and hydrocortisone) and an antagonist (RU-38486) in experimental animals (AP). Prednisolone is not mentioned in the statement, nor is there any connection made between glucocorticoids and Duchenne muscular dystrophy in the provided context. Therefore, it is not reasonable to infer any relationship between Prednisolone and Duchenne muscular dystrophy based on this statement alone."

The statement ""The adrenal cortex and hydrocortisone metabolism in experimental myocardial infarct"" pertains specifically to the adrenal cortex and hydrocortisone metabolism in the context of myocardial infarction (heart attack). Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid, which shares some properties with hydrocortisone (a natural glucocorticoid produced by the adrenal cortex), but it is not explicitly mentioned in the statement. Furthermore, while glucocorticoids like Prednisolone can be used in treating asthma symptoms due to their anti-inflammatory effects, there is no direct connection made between Prednisolone and asthma in the statement provided."
7844202,Prednisolone related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,268,[Intraarticular hydrocortisone (cortril) in arthritis and osteoarthritis].,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""[Intraarticular hydrocortisone (cortril) in arthritis and osteoarthritis].""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"" because it discusses intraarticular hydrocortisone (cortril) usage in arthritis and osteoarthritis, which is unrelated to Prednisolone and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used primarily in treating various inflammatory diseases like asthma, allergies, and autoimmune conditions; it is not typically associated with COPD treatment.

         The statement provided focuses on hydrocortisone usage in arthritis and osteoarthritis management; hydrocortisone is another type of corticosteroid that has anti-inflammatory properties but is structurally different from Prednisolone. Therefore, it does not provide any relevant context or evidence linking Prednisolone to COPD.

         It is essential to ensure that any evidence used for supporting scientific claims is both relevant and accurate in order to maintain credibility in research and avoid drawing misleading conclusions based on unrelated information."
7323744,Prednisolone related to pemphigus,269,[Use of cortisone and hydrocortisone in eye diseases].,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to pemphigus"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""[Use of cortisone and hydrocortisone in eye diseases].""?","No, the statement ""Use of cortisone and hydrocortisone in eye diseases"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to pemphigus."" 

        Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in dermatology for its anti-inflammatory properties, while cortisone and hydrocortisone are naturally occurring glucocorticoids also used for their anti-inflammatory effects in various medical conditions including eye diseases. Although all three compounds belong to the glucocorticoid class of steroid hormones, they do not specifically indicate any relationship between prednisolone and pemphigus in the given statement.

        Pemphigus is an autoimmune blistering disorder affecting mucous membranes and skin. The relationship between prednisolone and pemphigus is usually in the context of treatment since glucocorticoids like prednisolone can help manage pemphigus symptoms by suppressing the immune system response responsible for blister formation. However, no such context is provided in the statement about cortisone and hydrocortisone use"
7262473,Prednisolone related to rheumatoid arthritis,270,[Topical use of hydrocortisone in otitis externa].,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to rheumatoid arthritis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""[Topical use of hydrocortisone in otitis externa].""?","No, the statement ""Topical use of hydrocortisone in otitis externa"" does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to rheumatoid arthritis."" 

        The reason is that these two statements discuss different medical conditions and treatments. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid used topically for treating inflammation in otitis externa (outer ear infection). Prednisolone is another corticosteroid but is often used systemically (orally) for treating various conditions including rheumatoid arthritis due to its anti-inflammatory effects.

        While both compounds belong to the same class of drugs (corticosteroids), their specific uses and indications vary based on factors such as pharmacokinetics, potency, and route of administration. Therefore, one cannot infer a relationship between Prednisolone and rheumatoid arthritis based on the provided statement about hydrocortisone use in otitis externa."
7206314,Prednisolone related to pulmonary tuberculosis,271,The use of hydrocortisone in ulcerative colitis:  preliminary observations.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to pulmonary tuberculosis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The use of hydrocortisone in ulcerative colitis:  preliminary observations.""?","No, the statement ""The use of hydrocortisone in ulcerative colitis:  preliminary observations"" does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to pulmonary tuberculosis."" 

        The statement discusses the use of hydrocortisone in ulcerative colitis, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, similar to prednisolone, but they are not identical drugs and have different pharmacological properties. 

        Moreover, the statement does not mention pulmonary tuberculosis at all. Therefore, even indirectly, there is no connection between the two phrases in terms of their subject matter or implications. 

        It is important in science to critically evaluate each piece of evidence in its own context and not draw broad conclusions without substantial evidence. This helps maintain the integrity of scientific inquiry and prevents the dissemination of misinformation."
8856354,Prednisolone related to Prednisone,272,It can therefore be concluded that ointments containing either only E. coli BCS or a combination of BCS and hydrocortisone provide significant relief in perianal eczema as well as in early stages of hemorrhoidal disease.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone related to Prednisone"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""It can therefore be concluded that ointments containing either only E. coli BCS or a combination of BCS and hydrocortisone provide significant relief in perianal eczema as well as in early stages of hemorrhoidal disease.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone related to Prednisone."" The statement discusses the therapeutic effects of ointments containing Escherichia coli BCS (BCS) alone or in combination with hydrocortisone on perianal eczema and early stages of hemorrhoidal disease. Prednisolone and Prednisone are both corticosteroids but unrelated to E. coli BCS or hydrocortisone in this context.

         To establish a relationship between Prednisolone and Prednisone in this context, there would need to be specific evidence linking these two corticosteroids in terms of their effects on perianal eczema or hemorrhoidal disease. As it stands, there is no mention of Prednisolone or Prednisone in the provided statement; therefore, no indirect support can be inferred."
26879702,Prednisolone has part acute lymphoblastic leukemia,273,The effect on cortisol supports the above conclusion and is consistent with HPA axis perturbation in opioid dependence as reported in other studies and extends these observations to stable methadone-maintained patients.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone has part acute lymphoblastic leukemia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The effect on cortisol supports the above conclusion and is consistent with HPA axis perturbation in opioid dependence as reported in other studies and extends these observations to stable methadone-maintained patients.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone has part acute lymphoblastic leukemia."" The statement discusses the effect of cortisol in opioid dependence and its consistency with other studies on methadone-maintained patients. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid medication used for various conditions such as inflammation, allergies, and autoimmune disorders; it has no direct connection to acute lymphoblastic leukemia based on the provided statement."
26670577,Prednisolone has part plasma cell myeloma,274,Several randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of a replacement therapy with hydrocortisone in severe sepsis.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone has part plasma cell myeloma"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Several randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of a replacement therapy with hydrocortisone in severe sepsis.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone has part plasma cell myeloma."" The statement discusses randomized controlled trials that evaluate the efficacy of hydrocortisone replacement therapy in severe sepsis patients. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used in various clinical settings for its anti-inflammatory effects; it is not inherently related to plasma cell myeloma, which is a type of cancer involving plasma cells.

        The two concepts - hydrocortisone replacement therapy in sepsis patients and Prednisolone's potential relationship with plasma cell myeloma - belong to different domains of medical science. The first is related to sepsis treatment, while the second is associated with cancer pathophysiology. Therefore, it is essential to maintain focus on specific scientific questions and avoid drawing unwarranted connections between unrelated concepts based on insufficient evidence."
18935086,Prednisolone coexists with Prednisone,275,[Diurnal variations in blood glucose and plasma cortisol in juvenile diabetes mellitus without ketoacidosis].,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone coexists with Prednisone"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""[Diurnal variations in blood glucose and plasma cortisol in juvenile diabetes mellitus without ketoacidosis].""?","No, the statement ""Diurnal variations in blood glucose and plasma cortisol in juvenile diabetes mellitus without ketoacidosis"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone coexists with Prednisone."" 

         The statement discusses diurnal variations in blood glucose and plasma cortisol in juvenile diabetes mellitus without ketoacidosis. While both Prednisolone and Prednisone are corticosteroids that can influence plasma cortisol levels, the statement does not mention or imply the use of these specific drugs in the study population. Therefore, it does not provide any evidence for their coexistence in any context.

         Prednisolone and Prednisone are two different medications within the same class of drugs (corticosteroids), each having unique properties that may make one more suitable than the other depending on the clinical situation. They cannot ""coexist"" in an individual as they would be used interchangeably based on clinical judgment rather than being administered simultaneously for the same purpose."
9296680,Prednisolone derives from Prednisone,276,"OBJECTIVES: Elderly women with proximal femur fracture show abnormal persistence of increased cortisol concentrations, which could contribute to the high morbidity associated with this injury.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone derives from Prednisone"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""OBJECTIVES: Elderly women with proximal femur fracture show abnormal persistence of increased cortisol concentrations, which could contribute to the high morbidity associated with this injury.""?","No, the statement does not provide direct or indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone derives from Prednisone."" 

         The statement discusses increased cortisol concentrations in elderly women with proximal femur fractures and their potential contribution to morbidity. Neither Prednisolone nor Prednisone is mentioned in the statement. 

         Prednisolone and Prednisone are both corticosteroids used in medical treatment, but they have different chemical structures and properties. Prednisone is a prodrug that is converted to Prednisolone in the body after administration. Therefore, Prednisolone does not derive from Prednisone in the literal sense of the word. 

         However, it is important to note that both drugs have similar therapeutic effects due to their similar mechanisms of action as corticosteroids. But this fact does not make Prednisolone derive from Prednisone in any way."
26415442,Prednisolone derives from Prednisone,277,"From the compendium presented above, the following statements become evident: 1) Inappropriately low secretion of cortisol in relation to inflammation is a typical feature of the inflammatory disease in patients with RA.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone derives from Prednisone"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""From the compendium presented above, the following statements become evident: 1) Inappropriately low secretion of cortisol in relation to inflammation is a typical feature of the inflammatory disease in patients with RA.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for ""Prednisolone derives from Prednisone."" The statement discusses a feature of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but does not make any connection between Prednisolone and Prednisone.

        Prednisolone and Prednisone are both corticosteroids used in treating inflammation and autoimmune disorders like RA. However, they have different chemical structures due to variations in their side chains. Prednisone is metabolized into Prednisolone in the body by enzymes in the liver. Therefore, Prednisolone is not derived from Prednisone in terms of chemical synthesis but rather as an active metabolite in vivo.

        The statement provided focuses on cortisol secretion in RA patients, which is not related to Prednisolone being derived from Prednisone. Hence, it does not offer any indirect support for that claim."
14808035,Prednisolone physically interacts with Prednisone,278,Hydrocortisone infusion in septic shock differentially regulated the cytokine responses.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone physically interacts with Prednisone"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Hydrocortisone infusion in septic shock differentially regulated the cytokine responses.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone physically interacts with Prednisone."" 

        The statement ""Hydrocortisone infusion in septic shock differentially regulated the cytokine responses"" is about hydrocortisone, not prednisolone or prednisone. These three substances belong to the class of glucocorticoids but they are different molecules with distinct pharmacological properties. 

        Furthermore, even if the statement were about prednisolone or prednisone, it would still not imply a direct physical interaction between these two substances. It would suggest an effect on cytokine responses, which is a biological effect, not a physical interaction. 

        Therefore, based on the provided statement, there is no indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone physically interacts with Prednisone."""

The background statement discusses dysregulation of cortisol secretion, hippocampal abnormalities, and memory deficits in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders but does not mention Prednisolone or Prednisone nor imply any interaction between these two substances. Prednisolone and Prednisone are both corticosteroids used for their anti-inflammatory effects; however, they have different pharmacological profiles due to differences in their chemical structures and metabolism. While they may share some biological targets, they do not physically interact in terms of forming chemical bonds or complexes."
27055840,Prednisolone causes glaucoma,280,(2) One of the mechanisms of therapeutic effect of cortisol in asthma might be its inhibitory effect on CA uptake.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone causes glaucoma"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""(2) One of the mechanisms of therapeutic effect of cortisol in asthma might be its inhibitory effect on CA uptake.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone causes glaucoma."" Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid, similar to cortisol, often used in treating inflammatory diseases such as asthma. The mechanism mentioned in the statement refers to cortisol inhibiting catecholamine (CA) uptake in asthma treatment. Although both Prednisolone and cortisol have anti-inflammatory effects, there is no direct link established between cortisol inhibiting CA uptake and Prednisolone causing glaucoma.

        Glaucoma is an eye condition associated with increased pressure within the eye, which can lead to optic nerve damage and vision loss if untreated. While long-term steroid use (including Prednisolone) has been linked to an increased risk of developing secondary glaucoma in some individuals due to altered intraocular pressure, it does not automatically mean that Prednisolone causes glaucoma in every patient. The development of glaucoma involves multiple factors, including genetics, age, and overall health status.

The objective of the study mentioned is to compare cortisol levels, diurnal cycles of cortisol, and reactivity of cortisol to psychological stress in fibromyalgia (FM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in their natural environment. It also aims to examine the effect on results of accounting for differences among the groups in psychological stress and other lifestyle and psychosocial variables. Prednisolone is not mentioned in the objective, nor is there any reference made to uveitis, an inflammation of the middle layer of the eye, which is a known side effect of long-term corticosteroid use like Prednisolone. Therefore, there is no basis for drawing such a conclusion from this statement alone."
25953223,Prednisolone causes kidney disorder,282,"OBJECTIVES: Recent data suggest that higher plasma cortisol may be associated with hypertension and insulin resistance in otherwise healthy men, as it is in Cushing's syndrome.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Prednisolone causes kidney disorder"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""OBJECTIVES: Recent data suggest that higher plasma cortisol may be associated with hypertension and insulin resistance in otherwise healthy men, as it is in Cushing's syndrome.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Prednisolone causes kidney disorder."" The objective provided in the statement is about an association between higher plasma cortisol levels and hypertension as well as insulin resistance in healthy men, which is similar to what is observed in Cushing's syndrome. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that can increase cortisol levels in the body; however, the statement does not mention any kidney disorders related to cortisol increase nor does it make any direct or indirect reference to Prednisolone causing kidney disorders.

        To further clarify, it is important to understand that correlation does not imply causation; hence, even if there were evidence suggesting an association between Prednisolone use, increased cortisol levels, hypertension, and insulin resistance, it would not automatically imply that Prednisolone causes kidney disorders without additional supporting evidence specifically linking Prednisolone use to kidney issues.

        In conclusion, while Prednisolone might have various side effects due to its glucocorticoid activity, based on the information provided in the statement, there is no indirect support for Pred"

         Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in clinical settings for its anti-inflammatory effects. Adrenocortical insufficiency refers to the inadequate production of corticosteroids by the adrenal glands, which can be caused by prolonged exposure to exogenous glucocorticoids like Prednisolone, leading to suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

         However, the provided statement discusses higher mean plasma cortisol concentrations and greater responsiveness to exogenous ACTH in November in the southern hemisphere during reproductive quiescence in animals. Cortisol is one of the corticosteroids produced by the adrenal glands in response to ACTH stimulation from the pituitary gland. The statement does not mention Prednisolone or any exogenous glucocorticoid use; therefore, it does not provide any indirect support for the claim that Prednisolone causes"

         Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid drug often used in treating various inflammatory conditions such as ulcerative colitis (UC). It works by binding to glucocorticoid receptors in cells and modulating gene expression related to inflammation and immune response.

         The provided statement discusses cortisol metabolism in human obesity, specifically an impaired cortisone-to-cortisol conversion in subjects with central adiposity (excess fat around their midsection). Cortisol is another glucocorticoid naturally produced in the human body by the adrenal glands in response to stress.

         Although both Prednisolone and cortisol have similar functions in modulating immune response and inflammation due to their glucocorticoid activity, they have different sources (synthetic vs endogenous) and mechanisms"

The statement discusses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis's role in counterbalancing systemic inflammation through changes in adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that can mimic the effects of cortisol in the body; however, it does not necessarily cause headaches as a direct side effect. Headaches might be an indirect consequence of Prednisolone usage due to other factors such as changes in fluid balance, sleep patterns, or mood disturbances that can occur during treatment. Nonetheless, without explicit evidence linking Prednisolone usage to headaches in the provided statement, it does not offer support for that claim."

The statement discusses the effects of hypoxic exposure on zebrafish at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), including increases in whole body cortisol levels and expression of certain stress response regulators (crf, uts1, hsd20b2). While cortisol is known as a stress hormone that can be influenced by Prednisolone, no connection is established between these hypoxia-induced changes in zebrafish and Prednisolone-induced nephrotic syndrome in humans or other animals.

        To provide indirect support for the claim, there would need to be some link between Prednisolone usage, cortisol levels, stress response regulation, and nephrotic syndrome development. However, based on the information provided in the statement, no such link has been established.

The provided statement discusses correlations between HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) on admission in an insulin resistance (IR) group and several hormones, including cortisol. However, it does not mention Prednisolone or infertility disorder.

         The correlation between cortisol and HOMA-IR on admission in an IR group does not necessarily imply causation, nor does it specify that Prednisolone is responsible for increased cortisol levels. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in treating various inflammatory diseases; however, its potential effects on fertility would require separate investigation and evidence.

         In summary, while cortisol has been linked to menstrual dysfunction and potential infertility in women when produced in excess (either due to Cushing's syndrome or exogenous administration), there is no direct evidence in the statement provided that connects Prednisolone use to infertility disorder."

The statement discusses the suppression of anti-inflammatory effects of cortisol in states of excessive stress leading to hypercatabolic diseases like AIDS, sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, and protein calorie malnutrition (NAIDS). Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used for its potent anti-inflammatory effects in various medical conditions. While it can have side effects such as skin thinning and increased susceptibility to infections, it does not directly cause exfoliative dermatitis based on the provided information alone.

         However, it is important to note that glucocorticoids like Prednisolone can have cutaneous side effects such as exacerbation of existing skin conditions, delayed wound healing, skin thinning, purpura, striae, acneiform eruptions, and hirsutism (Bolognia et al., 2018). Exfoliative dermatitis is characterized by widespread erythema and scaling involving most of the body surface area (Bolognia"

The case report describes an individual who experienced adverse effects from using budesonide, a type of corticosteroid, in both nasal spray and bronchial inhaler forms. Prednisolone is also a corticosteroid but is not mentioned in the case report. The association between budesonide use and various symptoms does not imply that prednisolone causes pulmonary tuberculosis.

        To further elaborate on why there is no indirect support for the claim, let us consider some key points. Firstly, prednisolone is not mentioned in the case report at all; therefore, there is no direct evidence linking its use to pulmonary tuberculosis in this scenario. Secondly, although prednisolone is a corticosteroid like budesonide, it has different pharmacokinetic properties, routes of administration, and potential side effects.

        The misconception might arise from assuming that all corticosteroids share identical properties and risks, which is not accurate. While it is true that corticosteroids can have"

The study mentioned in the statement investigates hydrocortisone-induced blood pressure reduction in a patient suffering from anterior pituitary hypofunction due to an allergic reaction. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid similar to hydrocortisone in its therapeutic effects but unrelated in causing cataracts in patients.

        The two statements discuss different corticosteroids (hydrocortisone vs prednisolone) and focus on entirely separate medical issues (blood pressure reduction vs cataract formation). Therefore, no reasonable inference can be drawn from one statement to support the claim in another statement regarding cataract development caused by prednisolone use.

        In summary, it is essential to maintain focus on specific evidence related to prednisolone when addressing the question at hand since other corticosteroids like hydrocortisone may have different side effects profiles."

The statement discusses fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol levels in response to hypoxia, which is not directly related to Prednisolone or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in treating inflammatory diseases due to its anti-inflammatory effects, while SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by chronic inflammation due to immune system dysfunction. Although glucocorticoids like Prednisolone can have various side effects, including immunosuppression, there is no established causal relationship between Prednisolone use and development of SLE based on the provided information."

        Prednisolone and Prednisone are both synthetic glucocorticoids, which means they have similar mechanisms of action in the body. They bind to the glucocorticoid receptor and modulate gene expression, leading to various physiological effects. One of these effects is the counteraction of insulin signaling, as mentioned in your statement. 

        Therefore, if Prednisolone affects insulin signaling in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue as described, then it is reasonable to infer that Prednisone would have similar effects, given their structural and functional similarities. 

        However, it is important to note that while there is indirect support for the statement ""Prednisolone affects Prednisone,"" this does not necessarily mean that Prednisolone has exactly the same effects as Prednisone in terms of potency, duration of action, or specific tissue targets. These aspects would need to be investigated through direct comparative studies.

        Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in treating asthma due to its anti-inflammatory properties that help reduce airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness [1]. On the other hand, congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is an inherited disorder of cortisol synthesis that can result in false elevation of plasma cortisol due to impaired feedback mechanisms [2].

        Although both prednisolone and CAH involve cortisol regulation, they represent different biological contexts. The statement about CAH does not provide any information about prednisolone or its effects on asthma; therefore, it does not offer any indirect support for the claim that prednisolone affects asthma.

The statement discusses a potential subset of patients who cannot appropriately respond immunosuppressively to stress through cortisol upregulation, which may exacerbate their psoriasis. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used for its anti-inflammatory effects in various conditions like psoriasis; however, it does not explicitly mention any connection between Prednisolone use and headaches.

        To establish indirect support for ""Prednisolone affects Headache,"" there should be some linkage between Prednisolone use and headaches in existing literature or biological plausibility. Although corticosteroids like Prednisolone have been associated with headaches as side effects (Hall et al., 2015), the current statement does not provide enough context for such an inference.

The statement discusses a case report of hydrocortisone-responsive hypotension and transient CIRCI (Compensatory Anti-inflammatory Response Syndrome Critical Illness) associated with naturally occurring septic shock in a dog. It does not mention Prednisolone or its relationship with Prednisone.

        Prednisolone and Prednisone are both corticosteroids used for their anti-inflammatory effects. Prednisone is metabolized into Prednisolone in the liver after absorption. Therefore, while they have similar effects, Prednisolone does not ""input"" Prednisone; rather, it is a metabolite of Prednisone.

        Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone used in medical treatment for various conditions including uveitis due to its potent anti-inflammatory effects. The statement given discusses congenital adrenal hyperplasias (CAH), which are genetic disorders affecting cortisol production and adrenal sex steroid secretion in the adrenal glands. Although both Prednisolone and CAH involve cortisol production, they represent different biological contexts.

        The statement about CAH does not mention Prednisolone nor uveitis; therefore, it does not provide any support for the claim that Prednisolone disrupts uveitis. The relationship between these two statements can only be established if there is evidence showing that Prednisolone-induced disruption of uveitis is linked to CAH-related decreased cortisol production or excessive adrenal sex steroid secretion, which is not suggested by the given statement."

        Hydrocortisone and Prednisolone are both corticosteroids used in treating various conditions, but they have different chemical structures and pharmacological properties. Hydrocortisone is primarily used for its anti-inflammatory effects in treating skin conditions, whereas Prednisolone is often used for its immunosuppressive properties in treating various immune-mediated disorders like hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).

        The statement about hydrocortisone's effect on skin-surface trauma is not related to HES, which is characterized by an abnormal increase in eosinophils (a type of white blood cell) in the bloodstream and tissues. Prednisolone's disruption of HES is attributed mainly to its immunosuppressive properties that help regulate eosinophil production and activation.

        Hydrocortisone and Prednisolone are both corticosteroids, but they have different specific uses and effects in the body due to their slightly different chemical structures. Hydrocortisone is primarily used for its anti-inflammatory effects in conditions such as synovial inflammation (inflammation of the synovial membrane in joints), while Prednisolone is often used for its immunosuppressive effects in conditions such as asthma.

        Therefore, while the statement about hydrocortisone's action in synovial inflammation is true, it does not indirectly support the statement about Prednisolone disrupting asthma. The two statements involve different corticosteroids acting in different bodily systems (the immune system in the case of Prednisolone and asthma, and the inflammatory response in joints in the case of hydrocortisone).

        Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid drug that is often used to reduce inflammation because it mimics the function of cortisol, a hormone naturally produced by the body in response to stress. Cortisol helps regulate metabolism, immune response, and stress response by binding to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) in cells throughout the body. Prednisolone also binds to these receptors and influences gene expression, which can lead to decreased inflammation.

        

        The statement ""The effects of stressful life events, coping, and cortisol on HIV infection"" implies that cortisol has an impact on immune function, which is closely linked to inflammation. Stressful life events can increase cortisol levels in the body, which in turn can affect immune cell function and potentially influence HIV infection outcomes.

         The statement provided mentions three different treatments (cyclophosphamide, hydrocortisone, and a second injection of virus) that were used in an attempt to prolong the anti-tumor effect in mice. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid similar to prednisolone but they are not identical compounds. Even if they had similar effects on synovitis (which is not stated in the provided information), it would still not provide support for prednisolone specifically preventing synovitis since hydrocortisone was only given as part of an anti-tumor treatment regimen rather than as a targeted therapy for synovitis prevention.

         Furthermore, synovitis was not mentioned in the original statement as being affected by any of these treatments; therefore, no indirect evidence can be inferred regarding prednisolone preventing synovitis based on that statement alone."

The initial statement discusses cortisol increases being related to memory impairments in elderly humans over five years. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used as an anti-inflammatory drug and has some structural similarity to cortisol; however, it does not necessarily imply that it prevents leprosy.

         The connection between cortisol (a stress hormone) and memory impairment in elderly individuals does not provide any direct or indirect evidence that Prednisolone has an impact on leprosy prevention.

Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid hormone that acts similarly to cortisol in the body. The statement suggests that an increase in cortisol production (and reduction of DHEA) could contribute to inflammation in HIV infection due to a shift from type 1 to type 2 cytokine production. Since Prednisolone has anti-inflammatory effects by reducing cytokine production (similar to cortisol), it could potentially prevent inflammation in HIV infection by counteracting these effects. However, it is essential to consider that Prednisolone may have side effects that need careful monitoring in clinical settings."

The conclusion drawn in the statement is about using 24-hour urinary free cortisol as an index of adrenal cortisol production in patients with liver cirrhosis who have a high mortality risk. Prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used in treating various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases; it is not mentioned in the statement provided.

         The statement discusses cortisol levels in patients with liver cirrhosis as an indicator of mortality risk but does not mention any connection between prednisolone use and ulcerative colitis exacerbation. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to draw such conclusions based on the given statement without additional evidence linking prednisolone use and ulcerative colitis exacerbation."

        The statement discusses the cleavage of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) at sites of inflammation, releasing bioavailable cortisol which is an anti-inflammatory agent. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, also known as corticosteroid, which is used in treating various conditions such as inflammation, allergies, and autoimmune disorders due to its anti-inflammatory properties.

        However, HIV infectious disease is not mentioned in the statement nor is there any connection made between hydrocortisone (or cortisol) and HIV in any way. Therefore, it does not offer any indirect support for the given phrase.

        It is important to note that while hydrocortisone has immunosuppressive effects which could potentially impact immune function in individuals living with HIV, there is no direct evidence in the statement provided that specifically links hydrocortisone to HIV infectious disease."

        The statement discusses the relationship between race and the propensity to release cortisol, which in turn influences the development of type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes/metabolic syndrome. Cortisol is a type of glucocorticoid hormone that the body produces in response to stress; hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of this hormone often used in medication.

        While both cortisol and hydrocortisone have similar effects on the body (including increasing blood sugar levels), they are not identical. Moreover, the statement does not mention any connection between cortisol release and cardiac arrest. Therefore, it does not offer any indirect support for the claim that hydrocortisone is related to cardiac arrest.

        The Synacthen test is used to diagnose primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) by measuring the body's ability to produce cortisol in response to synthetic ACTH (Synacthen). A clear deficiency of cortisol production indicates Addison's disease but does not provide any information about Crohn disease or hydrocortisone use in relation to Crohn disease.

        Crohn disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid that can be used in treating Crohn disease but is not inherently related to Crohn disease itself.

         The statement discusses an adaptive response related to hydrocortisone (cortisol) production in relation to low-dose long-term hydrocortisone (LTH) therapy. It suggests that LTH is used to prevent excessive cortisol production that could negatively impact fetal growth and potentially lead to preterm delivery. This statement does not provide any evidence or imply a connection between hydrocortisone and adrenal cortex neoplasm (a type of tumor). Therefore, it does not indirectly support the claim that hydrocortisone is related to adrenal cortex neoplasm.

         It is important to differentiate between hydrocortisone as a medication used in therapy and as a potential factor in adrenal cortex neoplasm development. The two concepts should not be conflated based on the information provided in the statement alone."

         The statement discusses the reduction in local cortisol production and its implications on vascular and pulmonary inflammation. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, a hormone that the body naturally produces in response to stress. While it has anti-inflammatory effects, the statement does not mention or imply any connection between hydrocortisone and cirrhosis of the liver. 

         Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by replacement of liver tissue by scar tissue following liver damage, leading progressively to loss of liver function. While corticosteroids like hydrocortisone can have effects on various body systems including the liver, the statement does not provide sufficient evidence or context to suggest a relationship between hydrocortisone use and cirrhosis of the liver.

The use of hydrocortisone in treating adrenal insufficiency that may be caused by ketoconazole is consistent with hydrocortisone being related to chronic primary adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole can suppress adrenal function by inhibiting steroidogenesis, which could lead to adrenal insufficiency if not managed properly (Powell et al., 1992). By administering hydrocortisone throughout treatment, it is likely that healthcare providers aimed at preventing adrenal insufficiency secondary to ketoconazole therapy (Powell et al., 1992).

         However, it is important to note that while hydrocortisone is used in treating adrenal insufficiency in general, it does not necessarily mean that chronic primary adrenal insufficiency is explicitly supported by the statement alone.

This is a statement about hydrocortisone's effect on leukemias in mice, not about its relationship to borderline personality disorder in humans. 

        Borderline personality disorder is a complex mental health condition characterized by patterns of unstable relationships, distorted self-image, affective instability, marked impulsivity, recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats or self-mutilation, and in some cases, transient paranoid ideation or severe dissociative symptoms (APA, 2013). It is not typically associated with or treated with hydrocortisone, which is a corticosteroid hormone used primarily for its"

         The statement discusses the effects of hydrocortisone on various types of carcinomas and tumors but does not mention congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). CAH is a genetic disorder that affects the adrenal glands and is not directly related to carcinomas or tumors unless there is secondary malignancy as a complication of CAH treatment. Therefore, while hydrocortisone may have an impact on certain types of cancers as suggested in the statement, it does not necessarily imply a connection with CAH."

        The statement discusses the role of cortisol in newborns, particularly its stress-handling and anti-inflammatory properties. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, but nicotine dependence is not mentioned anywhere in the statement. Nicotine dependence is a complex phenomenon involving genetic, environmental, and psychological factors, which is not addressed in the statement about cortisol in newborns. Therefore, there is no indirect support for the connection between hydrocortisone and nicotine dependence from this statement."

11089023,Hydrocortisone related to pancreatitis,366,"Under normal conditions, stress induces increased cortisol secretion that counteracts inflammatory reactions.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone related to pancreatitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Under normal conditions, stress induces increased cortisol secretion that counteracts inflammatory reactions.""?","Yes, indirectly it does lend some support. The statement suggests that cortisol (which hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of) has an anti-inflammatory effect under normal conditions. Pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas. Therefore, if hydrocortisone is used in treating pancreatitis, it could be based on its anti-inflammatory properties. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that increased cortisol secretion is the direct cause of pancreatitis; in fact, high levels of cortisol could potentially exacerbate pancreatitis in some cases. Therefore, while there is some indirect support, it's also important to consider the potential for hydrocortisone to have negative effects in certain contexts."

         The reason is that while both statements involve hydrocortisone, they discuss different biological processes and outcomes. The first statement refers to hydrocortisone's effect on macrophage content in murine tumors, which is an immunological response. The second phrase refers to myocardial infarction, which is a cardiovascular event. 

         Although hydrocortisone has various effects in the body, including potential impacts on inflammation and immune response that could theoretically relate to cardiovascular health, the provided statement does not offer any direct or indirect evidence of such a relationship. Therefore, it is not appropriate to draw conclusions about hydrocortisone's relation to myocardial infarction based on this information alone."

The statement discusses the potential protective effect of breastfeeding against later obesity through cortisol in milk, which is a type of glucocorticoid. However, it does not mention hydrocortisone specifically nor does it discuss osteoarthritis. Hydrocortisone is one of several glucocorticoids; it is not synonymous with cortisol or glucocorticoids in general. Furthermore, osteoarthritis is not mentioned in the statement, so there is no connection made between glucocorticoids (or hydrocortisone) and osteoarthritis in this context."

        The statement in question discusses the potential protective effects of hydrocortisone (HC) against hyperoxic injury in the developing pulmonary vasculature. This is an entirely different context from otitis externa, which is an inflammation or infection of the outer ear canal. 

        The two statements discuss different physiological systems (pulmonary vasculature vs. outer ear canal) and different biological processes (protection against hyperoxic injury vs. inflammation/infection). Therefore, there is no reasonable basis for inferring a connection between the two based on these statements alone. 

        However, it is important to note that hydrocortisone is a corticosteroid often used in medical treatments for various conditions, including otitis externa, due to its anti-inflammatory properties. But this connection would need to be established through separate evidence directly linking hydrocortisone to otitis extern"

The statement discusses cortisol clearance in sepsis and its potential contribution to impaired adrenocortical function in critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, but the statement does not make any connection between cortisol clearance in sepsis and ulcerative colitis treatment. Ulcerative colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that may be treated with hydrocortisone, but the statement does not mention ulcerative colitis or its treatment. Therefore, it does not offer any support for the connection between hydrocortisone and ulcerative colitis."

         The statement suggests that hydrocortisone therapy was initiated as a preventative measure for adrenal insufficiency, prior to obtaining laboratory results for ACTH and cortisol levels. This is related to endocrine function rather than dermatological conditions such as atopic eczema. The connection between hydrocortisone therapy and atopic eczema is not mentioned nor implied in this statement."

The conclusion in the statement suggests that hydrocortisone use in intubated trauma patients decreases their risk of hospital-acquired pneumonia compared to placebo. However, it does not mention or imply any connection between hydrocortisone and sepsis. Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to infection, whereas hospital-acquired pneumonia is a localized infection of the lungs that occurs during hospitalization. While both conditions can be related to trauma and critical care settings, they are distinct clinical entities that may not necessarily share a common relationship with hydrocortisone use."

The conclusion states that intravenous hydrocortisone reduced the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cardiac surgery. This suggests that hydrocortisone has a protective effect against AF, which can be considered an injury in the context of cardiac surgery. Therefore, hydrocortisone is indirectly related to injury in this case because it reduces the incidence of AF, an injury associated with cardiac surgery. However, it is important to note that hydrocortisone itself does not cause injury but rather mitigates it in this specific context."

This support comes from the implied connection between hydrocortisone, insulin resistance, and inflammation in peripheral tissues.

         Hydrocortisone is a type of glucocorticoid that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects (1). The statement suggests that hydrocortisone could improve sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin by reducing insulin resistance in these tissues in horses with various disease states. Insulin resistance is often associated with chronic low-grade inflammation (2). Therefore, by improving insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues through hydrocortisone administration, one could indirectly reduce inflammation in these tissues as well.

         However, it is important to note that hydrocortisone can also have pro-inflammatory effects at higher doses (3). Moreover, long-term use of hydrocortisone is associated with various side effects such as immunosuppression, muscle wasting, and glucose intolerance (4). Therefore, further studies"

The statement discusses plasma cortisol concentrations in relation to bacterial infection but does not mention hydrocortisone or toxic shock syndrome. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, a hormone that the body naturally produces in response to stress; it is not typically associated with toxic shock syndrome. Toxic shock syndrome is instead associated with certain types of bacterial infections and the use of superabsorbent tampons. Therefore, without further evidence linking hydrocortisone to toxic shock syndrome, it is not reasonable to infer such a relationship based on the provided statement alone."

         The provided statement discusses the relationship between insulin, cortisol (which is a precursor to hydrocortisone), and adipogenesis (the formation of fat cells). It suggests that long-term stimulation of 11betaHSD reductase activity by insulin could potentially exacerbate visceral obesity due to the stimulatory effects of insulin and cortisol on adipogenesis. 

         However, dissociative amnesia is a condition related to memory loss where an individual cannot recall important personal information, usually as a result of trauma or stress. Hydrocortisone is a hormone that the body produces in response to stress; it is not typically associated with dissociative amnesia. Therefore, there is no indirect support for the relationship between hydrocortisone and dissociative amnesia in the provided statement."

The review article discusses plasma cortisol in relation to atrial fibrillation (AF) risk, not asthma. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic glucocorticoid that mimics cortisol in the body; however, there is no direct link made between hydrocortisone and asthma in the provided statement.

        To establish indirect support for ""Hydrocortisone related to asthma,"" there should be some connection between cortisol/hydrocortisone and asthma in existing literature. Although cortisol has been linked to asthma pathophysiology as an endogenous glucocorticoid, hydrocortisone is not typically used as an asthma treatment due to its short-acting properties compared to other exogenous glucocorticoids like fluticasone or budesonide.

        Justification: 

        Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands in response to stress. Adrenocortical insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, is a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol. 

        The statement ""Contribution of cortisol deficiency to septic shock"" implies that cortisol plays a crucial role in managing septic shock, which is a severe complication of sepsis that can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. In cases of adrenocortical insufficiency (AI), where cortisol levels are deficient, patients may be more susceptible to septic shock due to their inability to mount an appropriate stress response.

        The statement suggests that there is a synergistic effect between insulin and cortisol in stimulating energy deposition, which can contribute to obesity development. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid hormone that plays an essential role in metabolism and inflammation; hydrocortisone is one of its primary forms produced in humans by the adrenal gland.

        The statement implies that increased cortisol levels could lead to obesity due to its impact on energy deposition and insulin resistance. Since hydrocortisone is a form of cortisol, it can be inferred that high hydrocortisone levels might also contribute to obesity development through similar mechanisms.

        However, it is important to note that while there is indirect support for the connection between hydrocortisone and obesity disorder in this statement, further investigation is required for more direct evidence of such an association.

This is because hydrocortisone is one of the primary glucocorticoids in humans (the other being cortisol), and both hormones share similar physiological functions in stress response and immune regulation (Munck et al., 1984).

        Cortisol is known for its anti-inflammatory effects at physiological concentrations (Barnes, 2006). However, chronic exposure to high levels of cortisol can lead to glucocorticoid resistance in immune cells (McEwen et al., 1997). This resistance can result in uncontrolled inflammation due to impaired cortisol signaling (Rhen & Cidlowski, 2005).

The objective of the study is to investigate the relationship of cortisol concentrations during the first week of life to patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), markers of lung inflammation, and respiratory outcome in very low birth weight infants. Hydrocortisone is a synthetic form of cortisol, but the study does not mention hydrocortisone or toxic shock syndrome at all. Therefore, there is no basis for drawing such a conclusion from this statement alone.

        However, it is important to note that hydrocortisone has been associated with various side effects such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, and adrenal suppression when used in high doses or for extended periods. Toxic shock syndrome is a rare but serious complication associated with certain types of bacterial infections, and it is not typically linked to hydrocortisone use. Nonetheless, any use of medications should be done under the supervision of a healthcare provider who can monitor for potential side effects and adjust treatment accordingly."

The study referenced in the title is comparing two different treatments for Crohn's disease, budesonide and 6-methylprednisolone, which are both types of corticosteroids like hydrocortisone. However, the study does not mention or investigate any link between these treatments and sepsis. Therefore, it does not provide any relevant information to support the claim that hydrocortisone causes sepsis."

        The statement focuses on pharmacokinetics (the process of how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted) of high-dose methylprednisolone in hematological malignancies (blood cancers). It does not mention hydrocortisone or atopic eczema at all.

        Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid hormone used in various medical treatments including skin conditions like eczema; however, its use does not imply causation for atopic eczema but rather may be used as a treatment option due to its anti-inflammatory properties.

        Atopic eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition associated with immune system dysfunction; it can be triggered by various factors including genetics, environmental factors, and stress among others.

        Therefore, without further information linking hydrocortisone use"

The statement discusses Methylprednisolone, which is a different glucocorticoid than Hydrocortisone, used in treating advanced chronic lymphocytic leukaemia based on DiSC assay results. Fibromyalgia is not mentioned in the statement; therefore, there is no connection made between Methylprednisolone (or any glucocorticoid) and fibromyalgia in this context.

        To further clarify, Hydrocortisone and Methylprednisolone belong to a class of steroid hormones called glucocorticoids that have anti-inflammatory effects. Although both medications have side effects in common due to their glucocorticoid nature, they also have distinct properties that make them suitable for different therapeutic applications.

        The statement in question focuses on Methylprednisolone in treating advanced chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; hence it does not provide any evidence or reasoning that would support H"

The statement discusses the effects of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone on immunological and inflammatory processes in ankylosing spondylitis. Hydrocortisone is a different glucocorticoid medication than methylprednisolone, and hypotensive disorder is not mentioned in the statement. Therefore, there is no connection that can be inferred between hydrocortisone use and hypotensive disorder based on this statement alone.

        However, it is important to note that hydrocortisone, like other glucocorticoids, can have various side effects including hypotension (low blood pressure) in some individuals. This is due to their impact on the cardiovascular system, including fluid and electrolyte balance. Nonetheless, the provided statement does not offer any evidence or support for such an association between hydrocortisone use and hypotensive disorder."

The statement discusses an investigation into the effect of methylprednisolone (MP) on cell kinetic response to cyclophosphamide (CP) and Adriamycin (ADR) in C3H/HeJ spontaneous mammary tumors and hematopoietic tissue. Hydrocortisone is not mentioned in the statement, nor is hypoxemia, which is a condition characterized by low levels of oxygen in the blood. Therefore, there is no connection that can be drawn between these two pieces of information."
18446972,Hydrocortisone causes congenital adrenal hyperplasia,395,High-dose intravenous methyl-prednisolone in chronic polymyositis/dermatomyositis.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes congenital adrenal hyperplasia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""High-dose intravenous methyl-prednisolone in chronic polymyositis/dermatomyositis.""?","No, the statement ""High-dose intravenous methyl-prednisolone in chronic polymyositis/dermatomyositis"" does not provide indirect support for the claim that ""Hydrocortisone causes congenital adrenal hyperplasia.""

         The reason is that these two statements refer to different corticosteroids (hydrocortisone vs methylprednisolone) used in different medical contexts (congenital adrenal hyperplasia vs chronic polymyositis/dermatomyositis). Methylprednisolone is not hydrocortisone; therefore, any effects observed in one context cannot be automatically assumed for another corticosteroid in an entirely different context.

         Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is primarily caused by genetic mutations affecting enzymes in cortisol biosynthesis pathways, not by exposure to hydrocortisone during development as it is often used as replacement therapy in affected individuals (National Organization for Rare Disorders).

         In conclusion, while both hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone belong to the class of corticosteroids"

The statement is about a comparison between Intratympanic Gentamicin and Methylprednisolone in Meniere's Disease with Non-Serviceable Hearing. Hydrocortisone is not mentioned in this statement. Even if it were mentioned in conjunction with causing injury, one study or statement would not be sufficient evidence to support such a claim without further investigation into the specific conditions, dosages, and other factors that might contribute to any potential injury."

The study mentioned in the statement is about high-dose methylprednisolone, vincristine, MTX, and ara-C as initial bulk reducing therapy in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of unfavorable histology. Hydrocortisone is not mentioned in the study, nor is there any connection made between any of these drugs and influenza. Therefore, there is no basis for such a claim in this statement."

        The study in question compares the efficacy of two treatments for plantar fasciitis - PRP injections and methylprednisolone injections. Hydrocortisone is another type of corticosteroid, like methylprednisolone, but it is not mentioned in this study at all. 

        Furthermore, even if hydrocortisone had been mentioned in the study, it would still not provide indirect support for the claim that ""Hydrocortisone causes dermatitis, atopic"". A study on the efficacy of hydrocortisone in treating plantar fasciitis would not necessarily provide evidence for its potential side effects in other contexts. 

        Dermatitis, atopic or otherwise, is not mentioned in the study either. Therefore, there is no connection between the study"

The controlled trial mentioned in the statement investigates the use of 6-methylprednisolone in acute alcoholic hepatitis, not hydrocortisone. Although both 6-methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone belong to the class of steroid hormones called glucocorticoids, they have different chemical structures and properties that may lead to distinct side effects. Obesity is not commonly listed as an adverse effect of hydrocortisone treatment in clinical trials or pharmacological studies. Therefore, it is inappropriate to infer that hydrocortisone causes obesity based on this statement alone."
10068843,Hydrocortisone causes Inflammation,400,[Short-term therapy with methylprednisolone in exacerbated obstructive respiratory tract diseases].,False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes Inflammation"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""[Short-term therapy with methylprednisolone in exacerbated obstructive respiratory tract diseases].""?","No, the statement does not provide any indirect support for the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes Inflammation."" The statement discusses short-term therapy with methylprednisolone in exacerbated obstructive respiratory tract diseases. Methylprednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid, similar to hydrocortisone, which is used as an anti-inflammatory agent in various medical conditions. However, there is no mention of hydrocortisone in the statement nor any information linking it to inflammation.

        To further clarify, hydrocortisone is primarily used as an anti-inflammatory medication in various conditions such as allergies, asthma, and arthritis. It works by reducing the activity of the immune system and decreasing the production of chemicals that cause inflammation in the body. Therefore, it is inaccurate to claim that hydrocortisone causes inflammation based on the provided statement."
9850315,Hydrocortisone causes dissociative amnesia,401,Methylprednisolone and 60 Days in Hospital Survival in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes dissociative amnesia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Methylprednisolone and 60 Days in Hospital Survival in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia.""?","No, the statement ""Methylprednisolone and 60 Days in Hospital Survival in Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pneumonia"" does not provide indirect support for the claim that ""Hydrocortisone causes dissociative amnesia."" 

        The statement in question is a title of a scientific article that discusses a study on methylprednisolone, a type of corticosteroid, and its impact on survival rates in COVID-19 patients. Hydrocortisone is also a corticosteroid but it is not mentioned in this study at all. 

        Moreover, even if hydrocortisone was mentioned in the study, it would not automatically imply that hydrocortisone causes dissociative amnesia. Dissociative amnesia is a specific condition related to memory loss that is not typically associated with corticosteroid use. 

        Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no indirect support for the claim that hydrocortisone causes dissociative amnesia."

         The study in question is comparing the efficacy of ozone and methylprednisolone in treating carpal tunnel syndrome in systemic sclerosis patients. Methylprednisolone is a type of glucocorticoid, similar to hydrocortisone, but it is not the same compound. While both hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone can cause adrenocortical insufficiency when used over prolonged periods or in high doses due to their glucocorticoid nature, this study does not provide any evidence or mention of hydrocortisone use, let alone its potential to cause adrenocortical insufficiency. Therefore, it does not indirectly support the claim that hydrocortisone causes adrenocortical insufficiency."
9145908,Hydrocortisone causes otitis externa,403,Methylprednisolone Pulses in West Syndrome: A New Weapon in the Armory-Is it Needed?,False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes otitis externa"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Methylprednisolone Pulses in West Syndrome: A New Weapon in the Armory-Is it Needed?""?","No, the statement ""Methylprednisolone Pulses in West Syndrome: A New Weapon in the Armory-Is it Needed?"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes otitis externa."" The statement discusses Methylprednisolone Pulses as a potential treatment for West Syndrome without mentioning Hydrocortisone or Otitis externa at all.

        The lack of connection between these two statements is evident because they discuss different topics entirely; one focuses on Methylprednisolone as a treatment for West Syndrome while the other asserts that Hydrocortisone causes otitis externa. Since there is no overlap in subject matter between these two statements, it is not possible for one to indirectly support the other.

        To further clarify, let us examine how these statements relate to each other (or rather do not). The first statement discusses Methylprednisolone Pulses as an option for treating West Syndrome - which is a type of epilepsy characterized by spasms in infancy - but does not mention Hydrocortisone at all."
8699464,Hydrocortisone causes adrenal cortex neoplasm,404,Patient underwent treatment with milrinone and methylprednisolone that showed reduction in myocardial inflammation and significantly improved myocardial contractility.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes adrenal cortex neoplasm"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Patient underwent treatment with milrinone and methylprednisolone that showed reduction in myocardial inflammation and significantly improved myocardial contractility.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes adrenal cortex neoplasm"". 

        The patient was treated with milrinone and methylprednisolone, not hydrocortisone. Methylprednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used in medical treatments similarly to hydrocortisone, but it is not hydrocortisone itself. 

        Moreover, the statement discusses the effects of the treatment on myocardial inflammation and contractility, not on adrenal cortex neoplasms. Therefore, there is no connection between the treatment and adrenal cortex neoplasms in this statement.

        It is important to note that while glucocorticoids like hydrocortisone have been linked to adrenal cortex changes in some studies, such as cortisol-producing adrenal adenomas, they do not necessarily cause adrenal cortex neoplasms. The relationship between these factors is complex and not fully understood, requiring careful consideration of multiple factors and robust evidence before making any definitive conclusions."

The statement discusses neurological side effects of anticoagulants and muscular side effects of methylprednisolone, but it does not mention any connection between hydrocortisone and neoplasm (abnormal tissue growth or cancer). Hydrocortisone is a type of steroid hormone often used in medical treatments, and while it can have side effects, the statement provided does not offer any evidence that it causes neoplasm."
7929803,Hydrocortisone causes Insulin resistance,406,"Conclusion: Based on the current data, the efficacy and safety of local injection of triamcinolone and methylprednisolone at doses of 20 and 40 mg were associated with a significant improvement in pain, functional status, and strength.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes Insulin resistance"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Conclusion: Based on the current data, the efficacy and safety of local injection of triamcinolone and methylprednisolone at doses of 20 and 40 mg were associated with a significant improvement in pain, functional status, and strength.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes Insulin resistance."" The conclusion is about the efficacy and safety of local injections of triamcinolone and methylprednisolone at specific doses in improving pain, functional status, and strength. Hydrocortisone is not mentioned in the statement; therefore, it does not offer any basis for drawing conclusions about its potential effects on insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is a complex metabolic condition that can be influenced by various factors including genetics, lifestyle, medications, and medical conditions; thus, it is essential to evaluate each corticosteroid individually instead of generalizing across different types of corticosteroids based on limited information."
7432490,Hydrocortisone causes pancreatitis,407,OBJECTIVE: To validate the responsiveness of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory biomarkers to treatment with natalizumab and methylprednisolone in progressive MS and to examine the relationship between CSF inflammatory and tissue damage biomarkers.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes pancreatitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""OBJECTIVE: To validate the responsiveness of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory biomarkers to treatment with natalizumab and methylprednisolone in progressive MS and to examine the relationship between CSF inflammatory and tissue damage biomarkers.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Hydrocortisone causes pancreatitis."" The objective in the statement is focused on validating the responsiveness of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory biomarkers to treatment with natalizumab and methylprednisolone in progressive MS and examining the relationship between CSF inflammatory and tissue damage biomarkers. Hydrocortisone is not mentioned in this objective, nor is there any information linking its use to pancreatitis in this statement. Therefore, it does not offer any indirect support for that claim.

         However, it is important to note that even if hydrocortisone was mentioned in the statement, it would not automatically imply that hydrocortisone causes pancreatitis. A direct causal link would require robust evidence from well-designed studies specifically investigating this relationship."
26997315,Hydrocortisone affects congenital adrenal hyperplasia,408,The region was identified as a significant predictor of use of intravenous methylprednisolone in MCD and MN patients.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone affects congenital adrenal hyperplasia"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""The region was identified as a significant predictor of use of intravenous methylprednisolone in MCD and MN patients.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Hydrocortisone affects congenital adrenal hyperplasia."" The statement refers to intravenous methylprednisolone use in MCD (Minimal Change Disease) and MN (Membranous Nephropathy) patients, not hydrocortisone use in congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients. Hydrocortisone is a different type of corticosteroid than methylprednisolone, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a distinct condition from MCD and MN. Therefore, any potential relationship between methylprednisolone use in MCD/MN patients and hydrocortisone use in congenital adrenal hyperplasia patients would be highly speculative and not supported by the given statement."
26940919,Hydrocortisone affects cardiac arrest,409,"Clinical commentary on ""Two cases of anaphylactic shock by methylprednisolone in neuromyelitis optica"".",False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone affects cardiac arrest"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Clinical commentary on ""Two cases of anaphylactic shock by methylprednisolone in neuromyelitis optica"".""?","No, the statement ""Clinical commentary on 'Two cases of anaphylactic shock by methylprednisolone in neuromyelitis optica'"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Hydrocortisone affects cardiac arrest."" 

        The reason is that methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone are two different types of corticosteroids. Methylprednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid often used for its potent anti-inflammatory effects in various clinical situations such as anaphylactic shock. On the other hand, hydrocortisone is another type of glucocorticoid that is naturally produced in the human body and is often used as a replacement therapy for adrenal insufficiency.

        Although both drugs belong to the same class (glucocorticoids), they have different pharmacological profiles, including varying potencies, durations of action, and side effect profiles. Therefore, any evidence pertaining specifically to methylprednisolone would not necessarily extend to hydrocortisone.

        In addition, anaphylactic shock is not equivalent to cardiac arrest;"

The conclusion in the statement refers to two different medications, budesonide (an inhaled corticosteroid) and systemic methylprednisolone (a systemic corticosteroid), used in treating Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD). The study does not involve hydrocortisone nor does it discuss myocardial infarction (heart attack). Therefore, it does not provide any relevant information regarding hydrocortisone's potential effects on myocardial infarction."

        The clinical trial mentioned is focused on comparing the safety and efficacy of two different treatments (topical tacrolimus and methylprednisolone) for ocular graft-versus-host disease. Hydrocortisone is not one of the treatments being compared in this trial. Furthermore, sepsis is not mentioned in the statement at all. Therefore, there is no connection between the clinical trial and the effects of hydrocortisone on sepsis. 

        However, it is important to note that hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid, similar to methylprednisolone, which was used in the clinical trial. Corticosteroids have been studied in relation to sepsis, but the specific effects would depend on the dosage, timing of administration, and other factors. Therefore, while this particular clinical trial"

The study mentioned in the statement is investigating the efficacy of methylprednisolone injections in preventing postoperative pain and oedema associated with inflammation. Hydrocortisone is another type of corticosteroid like methylprednisolone; however, it is not explicitly mentioned in the study.

         Furthermore, even if hydrocortisone were mentioned in the study, it would still not provide indirect support for the statement since the study is not focused on osteoarthritis but rather postoperative pain management. To establish any connection between hydrocortisone and osteoarthritis, there would need to be specific evidence pointing towards its effects on osteoarthritis in either human subjects or animal models of osteoarthritis.

         In summary, while hydrocortisone is related to methylprednisolone as both being corticosteroids, there is no indirect support for hydrocortisone affecting osteoarthritis based on the provided statement since it does not involve hydro"

        The statement given discusses two treatments (gamma globulin and methylprednisolone) used in managing idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), a disorder characterized by low platelet counts. Methylprednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid similar to hydrocortisone; however, it does not establish a connection between hydrocortisone and psoriasis.

        Hydrocortisone is also a glucocorticoid but is primarily used for its anti-inflammatory effects in various conditions such as allergies, asthma, and dermatitis. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and rapid turnover of skin cells. While glucocorticoids like hydrocortisone have been used in treating psoriasis, it is not explicitly stated in the given statement"

        The two statements discuss different corticosteroids (Methylprednisolone vs Hydrocortisone) and their effects on different medical conditions (hepatotoxicity in Graves' ophthalmopathy vs dermatitis). Methylprednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid used primarily for its anti-inflammatory effects in various disorders, while Hydrocortisone is another type of glucocorticoid often used for its anti-inflammatory effects in skin conditions like dermatitis.

        The shared element between these two statements is corticosteroids; however, they discuss different corticosteroids, medical conditions, and outcomes (hepatotoxicity vs dermatitis). Therefore, there is no indirect support for the claim that Hydrocortisone affects dermatitis based on the provided statement about Methylprednisolone and"

The statement discusses the effects of methylprednisolone in orthognathic surgery, which is not directly related to hydrocortisone or fibromyalgia. While both methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone are glucocorticoids and might have similar effects in some contexts, the lack of specificity in the statement and the absence of any direct link between methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, and fibromyalgia preclude drawing such a conclusion from this statement alone."

        The reason is that methylprednisolone is not equivalent to hydrocortisone in terms of their pharmacological properties and clinical uses. Although both are glucocorticoids, they have different potencies, durations of action, and therapeutic indications. Methylprednisolone is primarily used for its anti-inflammatory effects in conditions such as osteoarthritis, while hydrocortisone is often used in treating various respiratory conditions including pneumonia due to its broader glucocorticoid activity and mineralocorticoid effects.

        Additionally, the study in question focuses on osteoarthritis of the hand, which is not related to pneumonia in any direct way. Therefore, even if the study found an effect of methylprednisolone on symptoms in osteoarthritis ("

        The two statements discuss different topics. The first statement refers to the long-term effects of high-dose methylprednisolone on aplastic anemia, while the second statement refers to the effect of hydrocortisone on atrial fibrillation. Methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone are both corticosteroids, but they have different chemical structures and pharmacological properties. Therefore, the results of one study using methylprednisolone cannot be indirectly applied to hydrocortisone without additional evidence supporting such a claim.

        Furthermore, even if both drugs belonged to the same class of medications, it would still be inappropriate to make indirect inferences without specific evidence demonstrating similar effects on similar biological processes or diseases. Therefore, without further information linking these two statements, there is no indirect support for the claim that hydrocortisone affects atrial fibrillation"

The statement discusses the efficacy of methylprednisolone, which is a type of corticosteroid like hydrocortisone, in treating pediatric IgA nephropathy, a kidney disease. There is no mention of lymphoma in the statement. Furthermore, even though hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone are both corticosteroids, they may not have identical effects on all diseases due to differences in their pharmacological properties. Therefore, it is not valid to infer that hydrocortisone would affect lymphoma based on the given statement about methylprednisolone."

The statement discusses the effects of glucocorticoids, specifically methylprednisolone and dexamethasone, on lymphocyte blastogenesis in atopic dermatitis (AD). Hydrocortisone is not mentioned in the statement at all, let alone in relation to leukemia. Therefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusions about hydrocortisone's effects on leukemia based on this statement alone."
18310128,Hydrocortisone affects toxic shock syndrome,420,"CONCLUSION: In this single-center trial, combined vasopressin-epinephrine and methylprednisolone during resuscitation and stress-dose hydrocortisone in postresuscitation shock improved survival in refractory in-hospital cardiac arrest.",True,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone affects toxic shock syndrome"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""CONCLUSION: In this single-center trial, combined vasopressin-epinephrine and methylprednisolone during resuscitation and stress-dose hydrocortisone in postresuscitation shock improved survival in refractory in-hospital cardiac arrest.""?","Yes, indirectly. The statement does not explicitly mention toxic shock syndrome but it does suggest that hydrocortisone (a type of steroid) can improve survival in refractory in-hospital cardiac arrest when used in postresuscitation shock. This implies that hydrocortisone has beneficial effects during shock states, which could potentially extend to toxic shock syndrome as it is also characterized by severe shock. However, this is an indirect inference and further direct evidence would be needed to definitively support the claim that hydrocortisone affects toxic shock syndrome."

The clinical trial mentioned in the statement compares two treatments (IV cyclophosphamide and IV methylprednisolone) for severe neurological manifestations in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Hydrocortisone is not one of the treatments being compared in this trial. Furthermore, even if hydrocortisone were mentioned in the study, it would still not provide indirect support for the effect of hydrocortisone on insulin resistance unless specific data or results related to insulin resistance were presented in the study."

        The statement refers specifically to 6-methyl-prednisolone, which is a synthetic glucocorticoid used in medical treatment, similar to hydrocortisone. However, it does not mention hydrocortisone or its effects on injury. 

        Henoch Schoenlein syndrome is a form of vasculitis that can be treated with glucocorticoids like hydrocortisone and 6-methyl-prednisolone. The statement indicates that there is a delayed hypersensitivity (an allergic reaction) to 6-methyl-prednisolone in some patients with Henoch Schoenlein syndrome. 

        While both hydrocortisone and 6-methyl-prednisolone are glucocorticoids and may have similar effects in some contexts, the statement does not provide any information about hydrocortisone"

        The reason is that while both hydrocortisone and 6-alpha-methyl prednisolone are glucocorticoids used in treating inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, they are different steroidal compounds with distinct pharmacokinetic properties. Hydrocortisone is a naturally occurring hormone in humans, while 6-alpha-methyl prednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid.

        The provided statement discusses the rectal absorption of radioactive 6-alpha-methyl prednisolone in ulcerative colitis patients but does not mention hydrocortisone or hypotensive disorders. Hypotension is an unrelated condition characterized by abnormally low blood pressure, which is not necessarily influenced by changes in glucocorticoid absorption in ulcerative colitis patients.

The statement discusses a controlled trial of pulse methylprednisolone versus two regimens of pulse cyclophosphamide in severe lupus nephritis. There is no mention of hydrocortisone or congenital adrenal hyperplasia in this statement. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid often used to treat various conditions such as inflammation, allergies, and skin conditions; it is not typically associated with lupus nephritis treatment. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disorder affecting the adrenal glands; it is not related to lupus nephritis. Therefore, there is no connection between the two statements that would allow for indirect support of the phrase in question."

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's ARDS Network is testing the use of methylprednisolone in late ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome). Methylprednisolone is a type of corticosteroid, similar to hydrocortisone, but it is not the same compound. While they share some mechanisms of action, they have distinct pharmacological properties that may lead to different effects on various conditions such as asthma. Therefore, it is not valid to infer that hydrocortisone has an impact on asthma based solely on this information about methylprednisolone use in ARDS treatment."

The statement discusses preliminary results of a study on methylprednisolone (a type of corticosteroid like hydrocortisone) being used in combination with an antiviral agent for improving peripheral vestibular function in vestibular neuritis. The study does not mention hypotensive disorder nor hydrocortisone, so it does not support the given phrase."

The statement discusses methylprednisolone use in spinal cord injuries (SCI) and its lack of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indication. Hydrocortisone is a different glucocorticoid than methylprednisolone; therefore, any effects on injury would not be supported by this statement. Additionally, the absence of FDA indication for methylprednisolone in SCI does not imply that hydrocortisone has an effect on injury."

        The statement is about the response of extraocular muscles to high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone in myasthenia gravis, which is a specific medical condition. Methylprednisolone is a type of corticosteroid, similar to hydrocortisone, but it is not the same compound. While both drugs have anti-inflammatory effects, they are not interchangeable in this context. 

        Furthermore, even if the statement had been about hydrocortisone, it would still not provide sufficient support for the claim that hydrocortisone affects inflammation. The statement would need to explicitly mention inflammation for it to provide any kind of support for that claim. 

        Therefore, based on the provided statement, there is no support for the phrase ""Hydrocortisone affects Inflammation."""

The statement discusses an experiment using methylprednisolone (MP) in a steroid-resistant lupus nephritis (SR-LN) mouse model, but it does not mention hydrocortisone or neoplasm (abnormal growth of tissue, often cancerous). Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid hormone produced by the adrenal gland, while methylprednisolone is a synthetic corticosteroid drug often used in medical treatments. Therefore, without further information linking these substances or their effects on neoplasm growth, it is not possible to infer that hydrocortisone has an impact on neoplasm based on the provided statement alone."

The compound MP is being administered in various ways and doses in relation to cytotoxic edema induction. However, it does not explicitly state that MP is hydrocortisone in this context. If MP is indeed hydrocortisone, then there is indirect support for the claim that hydrocortisone affects asthma because asthma is often associated with edema (fluid buildup in tissues) and hydrocortisone is known for its anti-inflammatory properties which could help reduce such edema. However, without explicit confirmation that MP is hydrocortisone, we cannot definitively say that this statement supports the claim that hydrocortisone affects asthma."

        The statement ""Methylprednisolone was temporarily stopped while a broad work up for inflammatory and neoplastic causes was pursued"" does not mention Hydrocortisone or Insulin resistance. Methylprednisolone is a glucocorticoid like Hydrocortisone, but they are not identical in their effects on the body. Even if they were, this statement only tells us that Methylprednisolone was stopped during an investigation, not that Hydrocortisone has an effect on Insulin resistance. 

        Insulin resistance is a complex metabolic condition that can be influenced by many factors, including diet, exercise, genetics, and certain medications. While some glucocorticoids have been associated with insulin resistance, this association does not hold true for all glucocorticoids under all circumstances. Therefore, even if Hydrocortisone were mentioned in the statement, it would not automatically imply that it affects insulin resistance.

The statement discusses the effects of an increased interval in the administration of Methylprednisolone (MP) on pain and neuropathic pain (NeP), not Hydrocortisone or dissociative amnesia. Hydrocortisone is a different glucocorticoid from MP, and dissociative amnesia is a distinct clinical entity from pain and NeP. Therefore, any potential effects of Hydrocortisone on dissociative amnesia would require separate investigation and evidence."

The statement discusses the side effects of high-dose methylprednisolone (20 mg/kg) treatment, including multifocal osteonecrosis (ON), thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and hyperlipemia. Hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid hormone that reduces inflammation and suppresses the immune system; it is not directly related to HIV infectious disease. Although hydrocortisone can have side effects similar to those mentioned in the statement, it does not imply that hydrocortisone causes HIV infectious disease."

         The statement provided is about a case report of toxic hepatitis induced by methylprednisolone, not hydrocortisone. Methylprednisolone and hydrocortisone are both corticosteroids, but they have different chemical structures and properties. Therefore, an adverse effect observed in one drug does not necessarily imply the same effect in another drug of the same class due to differences in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics.

         Moreover, toxic hepatitis is not equivalent to cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis is a chronic liver disease characterized by fibrosis and nodule formation leading to liver dysfunction, while toxic hepatitis is an acute liver injury caused by exposure to certain drugs or toxic substances.

         In summary, there is no indirect support for the claim that hydrocortisone produces cirrhosis"

The statement discusses the potential side effect of methylprednisolone, which is a type of corticosteroid, but it does not mention hydrocortisone or congenital adrenal hyperplasia. 

        Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disorder that results from mutations in genes responsible for producing cortisol and aldosterone in the adrenal glands. Hydrocortisone is a medication used to replace these hormones in individuals with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. It does not cause the disorder but can help manage its symptoms. 

        Therefore, without any additional evidence linking hydrocortisone to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase in question."

In fact, it does not mention hydrocortisone at all. The statement discusses high-dose steroids like dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in relation to their anti-tumoral action, which is unrelated to dermatitis, atopic or otherwise.

        Hydrocortisone is a type of steroid hormone used in various medical treatments, including as an anti-inflammatory agent for skin conditions like dermatitis. However, it can have side effects such as atopic dermatitis at certain dosages. Dexamethasone and methylprednisolone are different types of steroids that have their own set of potential side effects and uses.

        It is important to evaluate each claim based on its own merits and evidence rather than drawing conclusions from indirect associations or lack thereof."

        The statement discusses the effects of Methylprednisolone on certain biological markers related to inflammation and apoptosis (cell death). Hydrocortisone is another type of corticosteroid drug, like Methylprednisolone, but it is not mentioned in the statement. Therefore, we cannot infer any information about Hydrocortisone's effects on inflammation from this statement alone.

        It is important to note that corticosteroids like Hydrocortisone and Methylprednisolone generally have anti-inflammatory effects when used in therapeutic contexts; however, their impact can vary depending on factors such as dosage, duration of use, and specific physiological conditions."

        The reason is that Methylprednisolone and Hydrocortisone are both corticosteroids, but they are not identical. They have different chemical structures and pharmacological properties, which can lead to different therapeutic effects and side effects. Therefore, a study on Methylprednisolone does not necessarily imply anything about Hydrocortisone.

        Furthermore, even if it were about Hydrocortisone, the study does not mention type 1 diabetes mellitus as an outcome. Therefore, there is no basis for inferring a connection between Hydrocortisone and type 1 diabetes mellitus from this statement.

         The statement discusses a case of worsening of Diffuse Ocular Neuropathy (DON) due to soft tissue swelling secondary to Orthopedic Reduction (OR) despite cover with Intravenous Methylprednisolone (IVMP) in a patient previously responsive to IVMP alone. 

         While Hydrocortisone and Methylprednisolone are both corticosteroids and have similar effects in many contexts, they are not identical substances and do not necessarily produce all of the same effects under all conditions. The statement does not provide any information about Hydrocortisone use in relation to insulin resistance in this patient or in general. Therefore, it does not offer indirect support for the claim that Hydrocortisone produces insulin resistance.

Furthermore, even if hydrocortisone had been used, observing its use in one patient does not provide sufficient evidence for drawing conclusions about its potential side effects in other individuals. Obesity is a complex disorder that can have multiple causes, including genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and other medical conditions; attributing it solely to hydrocortisone use would be an oversimplification of its etiology."

The study in question focuses on methylprednisolone and its effects on human spinal cord injury when administered within 8 hours of injury. Hydrocortisone is a different glucocorticoid drug, and there is no mention of it in the statement provided. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to draw any conclusions about hydrocortisone based on this information alone.

        However, it is worth noting that hydrocortisone has been associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in certain contexts, such as in patients receiving high-dose hydrocortisone for septic shock (Annane et al., 2002). Nonetheless, such associations require separate evidence beyond the scope of the statement provided here.

Methylprednisolone is a type of corticosteroid, similar to hydrocortisone, but it is not the same compound. While they share some mechanisms of action, they are not identical. 

        Moreover, even if the statement had mentioned hydrocortisone specifically, it would still not provide support for the claim that hydrocortisone produces neoplasm (a new and abnormal growth of tissue in some part of the body, especially as a tumor).

13075196,Hydrocortisone prevents atrial fibrillation,476,"Methylprednisolone prevents the development of autotomy and neuropathic edema in rats, but has no effect on nociceptive thresholds.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone prevents atrial fibrillation"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Methylprednisolone prevents the development of autotomy and neuropathic edema in rats, but has no effect on nociceptive thresholds.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Hydrocortisone prevents atrial fibrillation."" 

        The statement discusses the effects of Methylprednisolone on rats, particularly in preventing autotomy and neuropathic edema, and having no effect on nociceptive thresholds. Methylprednisolone is a type of glucocorticoid, similar to Hydrocortisone, but it is not the same compound. 

        Furthermore, the conditions studied in rats (autotomy, neuropathic edema, nociceptive thresholds) are not related to atrial fibrillation in humans. Therefore, even if Hydrocortisone had shown similar effects in a similar study, it would not necessarily imply that Hydrocortisone prevents atrial fibrillation in humans. 

        In conclusion, while these two statements both discuss glucocorticoids, they study different compounds and different conditions, providing no indirect support for the claim about Hydrocortisone preventing atrial fibrillation."
12187318,Hydrocortisone prevents Insulin resistance,477,Chronically impaired renal function and the use of methylprednisolone may be the risk factors for SP.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Hydrocortisone prevents Insulin resistance"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Chronically impaired renal function and the use of methylprednisolone may be the risk factors for SP.""?","No, the statement ""Chronically impaired renal function and the use of methylprednisolone may be the risk factors for SP"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Hydrocortisone prevents Insulin resistance.""

        The statement discusses risk factors for something called ""SP"" (which I assume stands for Steroid-induced Psychiatric Symptoms based on context), one of which is methylprednisolone use. Methylprednisolone is a type of glucocorticoid steroid like hydrocortisone but has different properties in terms of potency and duration of action.

        Insulin resistance is not mentioned in either statement; therefore, there is no connection made between hydrocortisone use (or methylprednisolone use) and insulin resistance prevention in these statements.

        Insulin resistance is associated with conditions like metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which can be influenced by glucocorticoid use but require further investigation beyond these statements alone.

        In conclusion, these statements do not provide indirect support for ""Hydrocortisone prevents Insulin"

The statement discusses the use of an anti-inflammatory synthetic glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone) in treating acute spinal cord injury and investigating its mechanisms in inflammation shortly after injury. Hydrocortisone is also a glucocorticoid but is not mentioned in the statement; therefore, no inference can be made about its effects on sepsis based on this information alone. Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to infection, which may not be directly related to spinal cord injury or its treatment with methylprednisolone."

The statement discusses patients receiving ceftriaxone (Rocephin) injections for preventing bacterial infections during surgery. Hydrocortisone is not mentioned in this statement, so there is no connection that can be drawn between hydrocortisone and inflammation based on this information alone.

         However, it is important to note that hydrocortisone is a type of corticosteroid known for its anti-inflammatory effects when used in appropriate clinical settings. While it can suppress inflammation in some instances, paradoxical reactions may occur where corticosteroids can exacerbate inflammation in certain conditions such as allergic reactions or infections. Nonetheless, the statement provided does not offer any insight into hydrocortisone's potential relationship with inflammation."

         The statement discusses the opposite effect of ibuprofen on ethanol-induced cognitive impairment, which is suggested to be mediated by prostaglandins in tissue and animal models. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid medication used for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, and it is not mentioned nor implied in the statement. Edema, on the other hand, is the abnormal accumulation of fluid in the interstitial spaces of body tissues, which can be caused by various factors including inflammation, infection, trauma, or certain medications like corticosteroids. However, without specific evidence linking methylprednisolone to edema in the context provided, it is not possible to infer such a relationship based on the given statement."
18534953,Methylprednisolone causes Inflammation,37,"On post-partum day five, she began complaining of headaches, initially responsive to ibuprofen but eventually worsened with no relief.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Methylprednisolone causes Inflammation"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""On post-partum day five, she began complaining of headaches, initially responsive to ibuprofen but eventually worsened with no relief.""?","No, the phrase ""Methylprednisolone causes Inflammation"" does not receive at least indirect support from the statement provided. 

         Methylprednisolone is a type of corticosteroid medication that is commonly used to reduce inflammation in various conditions such as allergic reactions, arthritis, and asthma. The statement describes a patient who developed headaches on post-partum day five, which initially responded to ibuprofen but later worsened without relief. This scenario suggests that the headaches were not initially caused by inflammation since they responded to ibuprofen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). 

         Furthermore, methylprednisolone is not known to cause inflammation; instead, it suppresses inflammation by inhibiting the production of substances that trigger allergic reactions and inflammation in the body. Therefore, based on the information provided in the statement, there is no indirect support for the claim that methylprednisolone causes inflammation."
18260665,Methylprednisolone causes neoplasm,38,"Because ibuprofen protects from septic lung injury, we studied the effect of ibuprofen in oxidant lung injury from phosgene.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Methylprednisolone causes neoplasm"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Because ibuprofen protects from septic lung injury, we studied the effect of ibuprofen in oxidant lung injury from phosgene.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Methylprednisolone causes neoplasm."" The statement discusses the use of ibuprofen in preventing septic lung injury from bacteria (Escherichia coli) and oxidant lung injury from phosgene exposure in rats. Methylprednisolone is not mentioned in the statement, nor is there any connection made between methylprednisolone use and neoplasm development.

        To further clarify, neoplasm refers to an abnormal growth of cells in the body that can potentially become cancerous. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid used primarily for its anti-inflammatory effects in various conditions such as allergies, asthma, arthritis, and autoimmune diseases. While corticosteroids like methylprednisolone have been linked to certain side effects such as increased risk of infections, osteoporosis, and diabetes, there is no conclusive evidence connecting methylprednisolone use to neoplasm development.

        In summary, without any mention of methylprednisolone in the provided statement or"

The statement discusses the reduced incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers associated with lumiracoxib compared with ibuprofen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This information is not related to methylprednisolone or drug-induced liver injury. Therefore, it does not offer any indirect support for the claim that methylprednisolone causes drug-induced liver injury.

         To further elaborate, drug-induced liver injury is a specific adverse reaction that affects liver function. It is typically caused by certain medications, including some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen and lumiracoxib. Methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid commonly used for its anti-inflammatory effects in various conditions but has not been strongly associated with drug-induced liver injury compared to other medications like NSAIDs.

         In conclusion, while it is essential to remain vigilant about potential adverse reactions when prescribing medications like methyl"

        The two statements discuss different subjects - one refers to methylprednisolone affecting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), while the other refers to ibuprofen blocking fever induced by RANTES (a chemokine involved in inflammation).

        Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), while methylprednisolone is a corticosteroid; they have different mechanisms of action in the body. Ibuprofen primarily works by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes responsible for inflammation-related prostaglandin production, while methylprednisolone acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by suppressing the immune system response.

        Although both drugs have anti-inflammatory properties, there is no direct link between fever induced by RANTES being blocked by ibuprofen and meth"

        The two statements discuss different subjects - one is about anti-inflammatory drugs (paracetamol, ibuprofen, aspirin) and their potential association with cerebral palsy in children when used during pregnancy; while the other is about Methylprednisolone potentially preventing asthma.

        Although Methylprednisolone is also an anti-inflammatory drug (like paracetamol, ibuprofen, aspirin), there is no mention of asthma in the first statement nor any comparison between Methylprednisolone and other anti-inflammatory drugs in terms of preventing asthma. Therefore, it is not possible to infer any indirect support for ""Methylprednisolone prevents asthma"" from the given statement."

        The two statements are unrelated as they discuss different topics. The first statement refers to small studies investigating ivabradine's role in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in sinus rhythm, while the second phrase suggests a relationship between Cefotaxime and sepsis. Cefotaxime is an antibiotic used for treating various bacterial infections while sepsis is a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection causes widespread inflammation. There is no mention of Cefotaxime in the first statement nor any connection between ivabradine, MS, sinus rhythm, and sepsis that would allow for indirect support."

        The reason is that these two statements discuss entirely different subjects. The first statement pertains to Ivabradine, a medication used for heart failure, while the second statement refers to Cefotaxime, an antibiotic used for treating bacterial infections. There is no overlap in subject matter between these two statements that would allow for indirect support of one by the other.

        To further clarify, let us consider what would be required for indirect support. If there were an intermediate concept that connected these two statements (e.g., if Ivabradine were found to have antibacterial properties, which then affected bacterial infectious disease), then there might be room for indirect support. However, as no such connection exists in these statements, no indirect support can be inferred."

The statement discusses ongoing trials assessing the effects of ivabradine on various cardiovascular disorders such as heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, coronary artery disease (CAD), but it does not mention Cefotaxime nor peritonitis at all. Cefotaxime is an antibiotic used primarily for treating infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, while peritonitis is an inflammation of the peritoneum (the membrane lining the inner wall of the abdomen and covering the abdominal organs).

         To provide indirect support for ""Cefotaxime affects peritonitis,"" there should be some connection between Cefotaxime and peritonitis in the statement, either explicitly mentioning Cefotaxime as a treatment for peritonitis or implying its potential effects on peritonitis through related studies or evidence.

         The SIGNIFY study is unrelated to Ceftriaxone and its effects on bacterial infectious diseases. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic used for treating various bacterial infections, while ivabradine is a drug used in heart failure management to reduce heart rate. The two drugs have different mechanisms of action and therapeutic applications; therefore, any conclusions drawn about one drug should not be generalized to another unrelated drug without solid evidence supporting such conclusions.

         In order for there to be indirect support for Ceftriaxone preventing bacterial infectious diseases from the SIGNIFY study, there would need to be some connection between ivabradine, coronary heart disease, and bacterial infections that would suggest that if ivabradine cannot stop coronary heart disease progression, then Ceftriaxone can prevent bacterial infections.

        The statement describes a comparative study between two antibiotics, cefixime and cephalexin, in the context of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. While antibiotics can have anti-inflammatory effects as a secondary action, the primary purpose of these medications is to target and eliminate bacteria. Therefore, there is no explicit or implicit connection in this statement between neobiotics (newly introduced microorganisms) and inflammation.

        
        To establish a link between neobiotics and inflammation, one would need evidence showing that the introduction of new microorganisms is associated with inflammation in a specific biological context. The current statement does not provide such evidence or even mention neobiotics. Therefore, it does not support the phrase ""Neobiotic related to Inflammation."""

There is no mention of neobiotics or inflammation in this statement. Neobiotics refer to new forms of microorganisms that have been created through genetic manipulation, which is not mentioned in the statement. Inflammation is a biological response to harmful stimuli, which is also not mentioned in the statement. Therefore, without additional information linking these concepts together, it is not possible to infer that neobiotics affect inflammation based on this statement alone."

         The statement ""Objective: This study investigates the effect of TMZ in sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo and in vitro and molecular mechanisms"" is about an investigation into the effects of a specific chemotherapeutic agent, temozolomide (TMZ), on sunitinib-induced cardiotoxicity in both living organisms (in vivo) and in cell cultures (in vitro). The study also looks at the molecular mechanisms involved in these effects.

         A neobiotic refers to a newly introduced bioactive substance or organism into an environment. On the other hand, a neoplasm is another term for a tumor or an abnormal growth of cells. The statement does not make any connection between a neobiotic and a neoplasm, nor does it provide any information that would suggest that a neobiotic disrupts a neoplasm. Therefore, it does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Neobiotic disrupts neoplasm""."

        The statement is about trimetazidine, a medication used primarily for treating angina pectoris (chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart). The paper may discuss various roles of trimetazidine in cardiovascular disease, but it does not mention neobiotic nor bacterial infectious diseases. Neobiotic is an antimicrobial peptide that has been studied for its potential therapeutic effects in various contexts; however, it is not mentioned in this statement.

        To establish indirect support between these two phrases, there should be some connection between trimetazidine (or cardiovascular disease), neobiotic (or antimicrobial peptides), and bacterial infectious diseases.

This topic is unrelated to BLINATUMOMAB, which is an immunotherapy drug used for treating certain types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). 

        The two statements discuss different therapeutic areas (cardiovascular disease/diabetes vs leukemia/lymphoma) and drugs (Ranolazine vs BLINATUMOMAB), indicating no connection between them. Therefore, there is no indirect support for the relationship between BLINATUMOMAB and acute lymphoblastic leukemia from the given statement about Ranolazine in cardiovascular disease and diabetes management."
27155094,Ciprofloxacin related to endophthalmitis,98,"Furthermore, the activated Akt/mTOR signaling pathway induced by AF was further activated by ranolazine.",False,"'Does the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin related to endophthalmitis"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Furthermore, the activated Akt/mTOR signaling pathway induced by AF was further activated by ranolazine.""?","No, the statement ""Furthermore, the activated Akt/mTOR signaling pathway induced by AF was further activated by ranolazine"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin related to endophthalmitis."" 

         The two statements discuss different topics. The first statement is about the activation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in relation to atrial fibrillation (AF) and ranolazine. On the other hand, the second phrase connects Ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic, with endophthalmitis, an inflammation of the inner lining of the eye.

         To establish indirect support between these two phrases, there should be some common ground between them in terms of shared elements or concepts. However, in this case, no such connection exists based on the given information."
16836665,Ciprofloxacin related to Crohn disease,99,Recent evidence of beneficial effects of ranolazine (RAN) in type II diabetes motivates interest in the role of the late sodium current (INaL) in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin related to Crohn disease"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Recent evidence of beneficial effects of ranolazine (RAN) in type II diabetes motivates interest in the role of the late sodium current (INaL) in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.""?","No, the statement does not provide indirect support for the connection between Ciprofloxacin and Crohn disease. The statement discusses the potential role of ranolazine in type II diabetes by influencing glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through modulation of the late sodium current (INaL). This is unrelated to Ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used for treating various bacterial infections, or Crohn disease, an inflammatory bowel disease affecting any part of the gastrointestinal tract.

         While it is true that certain medications like Ciprofloxacin have been associated with increased risk of developing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn disease, in some studies (e.g., Svanes et al., 2001), these associations do not imply causation, nor do they indicate that Ciprofloxacin has any beneficial effects on Crohn disease.

         In summary, there is no indirect support for the connection between Ciprofloxacin and Crohn disease based on the provided statement. The two subjects belong to different domains of"
19572117,Ciprofloxacin related to DNA Gyrase,100,Effect of ranolazine in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary revascularization surgery.,False,"'Does the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin related to DNA Gyrase"" receive at least indirect support from the statement: ""Effect of ranolazine in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary revascularization surgery.""?","No, the statement ""Effect of ranolazine in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary revascularization surgery"" does not provide indirect support for the phrase ""Ciprofloxacin related to DNA Gyrase.""

        The reason is that these two phrases discuss unrelated topics. The first statement refers to ranolazine preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing coronary revascularization surgery, which is an investigation of a pharmacological intervention for cardiac arrhythmia in a surgical setting.

        On the other hand, Ciprofloxacin is an antibiotic that inhibits bacterial DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II), thereby inhibiting DNA replication in bacteria; it has no direct connection to ranolazine or postoperative atrial fibrillation treatment in patients undergoing coronary revascularization surgery.

        In conclusion, while both statements belong to medical research fields, they do not share any thematic relevance that would allow for indirect support between them."
