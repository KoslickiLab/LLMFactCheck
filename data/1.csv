11046187,mebendazole treats poisoning,47,"Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).",False,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats poisoning' supported by the sentence: 'Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).'?","No, the statement does not support that mebendazole (MBZ) treats poisoning. Instead, it suggests that mebendazole has cytotoxic effects on cells at certain concentrations when tested over a 42-hour culture period."
11046186,mebendazole treats cytotoxicity,48,"Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).",True,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats cytotoxicity' supported by the sentence: 'Longer incubation of the cells with MBZ resulted in stronger toxicity, and the cytotoxicity was dependent on the MBZ concentration above a certain threshold value (0.25-0.50 mg/l in a 42-h culture).'?","Yes, the statement supports that mebendazole (MBZ) can treat cytotoxicity as it mentions longer incubation causing stronger toxicity, which can be interpreted as increased treatment, and that there is a concentration-dependent effect above a certain threshold value, indicating a specific treatment range for dealing with cytotoxicity."
9926628,mebendazole treats Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung,49,Oral administration of MZ in mice elicited a strong antitumor effect in a s.c. model and reduced lung colonies in experimentally induced lung metastasis without any toxicity when compared with paclitaxel-treated mice.,False,Is the triple 'mebendazole treats Secondary malignant neoplasm of lung' supported by the sentence: 'Oral administration of MZ in mice elicited a strong antitumor effect in a s.c. model and reduced lung colonies in experimentally induced lung metastasis without any toxicity when compared with paclitaxel-treated mice.'?,"No, it is not directly supported because it is not specified that the secondary malignant neoplasm of the lung is being treated, nor is it specified that mebendazole is being used to treat it specifically, just that it has an antitumor effect in a general sense."
9926626,mebendazole treats spindle assembly,50,"MZ induces abnormal spindle formation in mitotic cancer cells and enhances the depolymerization of tubulin, but the efficacy of depolymerization by MZ is lower than that by nocodazole.",False,"Is the triple 'mebendazole treats spindle assembly' supported by the sentence: 'MZ induces abnormal spindle formation in mitotic cancer cells and enhances the depolymerization of tubulin, but the efficacy of depolymerization by MZ is lower than that by nocodazole.'?","No, it is not directly supported by the given sentence. The sentence mentions that mebendazole (MZ) enhances tubulin depolymerization but does not explicitly state that it treats spindle assembly issues, nor does it compare MZ's effectiveness to a specific treatment like spindle assembly treatment."
9926624,mebendazole treats Apoptosis,51,The anthelmintic drug mebendazole induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis by depolymerizing tubulin in non-small cell lung cancer cells.,True,Is the triple 'mebendazole treats Apoptosis' supported by the sentence: 'The anthelmintic drug mebendazole induces mitotic arrest and apoptosis by depolymerizing tubulin in non-small cell lung cancer cells.'?,"Yes, the statement is supported by the provided sentence. The sentence mentions that mebendazole, an anthelmintic drug, causes apoptosis (a type of programmed cell death) in non-small cell lung cancer cells, which aligns with the statement that mebendazole treats apoptosis. However, it's important to note that 'treats' might not be the most accurate term here, as apoptosis can be a part of both healthy bodily functions and diseases like cancer."
