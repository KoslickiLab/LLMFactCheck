1533,,,,,Nebivolol (NEB) in contrast to atenolol (ATE) may have a beneficial effect on endothelial function and may be more effective than ATE in preventing CVD.,,,,
1534,,,,,These data indicate that nebivolol prevents the development of the arterial hypertension associated with chronic NO deficit and this effect seems to be dependent on the inhibition of renin-angiotensin system.,,,,

1536,,,,,INTRODUCTION: Results from the multicenter trial (J-Land study) of landiolol versus digoxin in atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL) patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction revealed that landiolol was more effective for controlling rapid HR than digoxin.,,,,
1537,,,,,The purpose of this study was to investigate the prophylactic effect of continuous administration of low-dose landiolol on postoperative atrial fibrillation.,,,,
1538,,,,,"RESULTS: Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 4 (11.1%) of the 36 patients in the landiolol group, compared with 11 (32.3%) of the 34 patients in the control group, indicating that development of atrial fibrillation was significantly inhibited by landiolol (P=0.042).",,,,
1539,,,,,INTERPRETATION: Landiolol resulted in significantly more patients with sepsis-related tachyarrhythmia achieving a heart rate of 60-94 bpm at 24 h and significantly reduced the incidence of new-onset arrhythmia.,,,,
